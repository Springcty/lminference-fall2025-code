Once upon a time, there was a man by the name of Peter. He had a wife, Mary, and they had a daughter, who was called Jesus. One day, Jesus said to Peter, “Go fishing.” Peter said, “But we don’t have any food.” Jesus said, “I give you two fish, and twelve loaves of bread.” Peter replied, “We have no boats!” Jesus said, “I give you enough fish to feed everyone who is in this whole world!” Peter was amazed, but he also realized that he had only just scraped the surface. Still there were a lot of people who were hungry. So he grabbed

Once upon a time, the world's first computer was a big metal box, its screen nothing more than a black globe with a hand held light and a little paper that read like a menu. Then, somebody figured out a way to boil a frog, and all computers became much more like a giant black hole with the few lights like a bunch of glowing blue eyes. The computers we use today are made of blackboards with glowing blue eyes. It's the internet, where anything can be anything to anyone, not a giant black hole.
The reality of the internet is that people are talking to each other using a series of numbers. They figuratively speak to each

Once upon a time, a wise fellow said to me the following. He said “My dear friend, it is not a question of if, but when we will have a world that is free from disposal of chemicals!”. Being a true desire-knowing seeker I said with great pride, “Yes mister. We’ll surely get there”. He nodded somewhat knowingly and smiled but then he asked me something which he said “googlename@skype” “I have coined a word that describes the absence of chemicals in the air” he said “regularly chatting with me about that once in a while”.

3 + 5 = 9, but 5 - 3 =??
I have no idea how to solve this one. Would anyone be able to give a quick explanation?
You can get 9 in 3 different ways:
9 = (5 - 3) + 3
9 = 5 + (3 - 3)
9 = 5 + 0
What is wrong with getting 9 as a product of two subtraction terms?
5 - 3 = x + 3
9 = (x + 3) + 3
9 = (x + 3) + 9
9 = x + 12

3 + 5 = 23. Can you add 7 to 3? Your answer should be 34. So why is this 3 + 5 = 34? Doesn't that mean the answer should be 23? The reason the answer should be 23 is that the addition is carried until the last digit in the number equals 5.
You can tell this is another example of the number 23 being a special number because the sum 23 is 3 + 5 + 5 which is 23. It is also a special number because 5 + 5 + 5 = 24. All numbers between 3 and

Mathematics has always been one of my favourite subjects, therefore I am not surprised to discover that I have a 'passion' for mathematics at university but rather curious to discover just exactly what I am passionate about?
Strangely enough, a statistical experiment conducted by the BBC was the catalyst for me discovering my 'passion' for computer science.
A few years ago, the BBC conducted an experiment to see whether people's answers to a mathematical problem were random. Eighty people were asked whether they believed rain would have more or less volume if a grain of rice were deposited on it. Some people thought the 'volume

Once upon a time, I wanted to learn how to play the banjo. I had this notion that all I needed was to buy an instrument and I’d be able to play something, anything.
And as it turns out I was right. I was right, but I was wrong.
My initial attempts to learn were a little pathetic. I’d put on a DVD and pick up my banjo and try to copy what the instructor was doing. But I never understood what I was actually seeing. The instructor was saying something like “And now you do this” and I’d try to follow along. And as I followed along I’d get it wrong, or

Once upon a time, one hundred years ago today to be precise, a few hundred of my countrymen sat down at a school auditorium in Paris, France. A couple of their numbers spoke on behalf of an idea that was gaining momentum worldwide. An idea that more and more people were embracing. The idea was to achieve independence for the 200 million people that had been living under the colonial rule for over 100 years. 
The stars of the show that day were say President Knutsen of Norway, Dr. Herbert Samuel of the British government, Professor Joseph de Scoto of Belgium, David Lloyd George, British Prime Minister, Monsignor Gi

Once upon a time, there was a man who was looking for a house; he wanted to build a place for his family to live. But he didn’t have a lot of money, so he had to be very careful with how he spent it.
As he walked through the neighborhood looking for a good place to start building, he noticed an old house that had been abandoned for many years. The windows were broken, the doors were boarded up, and the yard was overgrown with weeds. But when he walked inside, he was surprised to find that there was nothing wrong with the foundation; the house was still sturdy and well-built!
So the man decided to
