Absolutely! Below is a creative and structured response to your request. We are generating **5 distinct dance formations** for a group of **8 people (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)** on an **8×8 grid stage**, with each cell either containing a person (represented by their letter) or being empty ("#" if unoccupied). 

We will:

- Place the **audience** at the **top edge** of the grid (row 0), facing the stage (so the audience is "above" the stage, looking down at the dancers).
- Ensure **A is the lead dancer** and is **always closer to the audience** than any other dancer — meaning A must be in a **row with the smallest row index** (since row 0 is closest to audience).
- Follow the specific rules for each formation:
  1. First formation: All dancers except A form a **line parallel to the audience** (i.e., a horizontal line, likely in the same row).
  2. Third formation: Some dancers form a **triangular shape**.
- All 5 formations are **distinct**, visually and structurally.

---

### 🎯 Stage Setup & Audience Position

- **Grid Size**: 8×8 (rows 0 to 7, columns 0 to 7)
- **Audience Position**: On **row 0**, directly above the stage. So, the **closer a dancer is to row 0, the closer they are to the audience**.
- **Row 0** = audience view (no dancers)
- **Row 1** = closest to audience (just below audience)
- **Row 7** = farthest from audience

---

## ✅ Formation 1: Line Formation (All except A in a horizontal line)

**Rule**: Dancers except A form a line parallel to the audience (horizontal line). A is closest to audience.

👉 A must be in row 0 or row 1. But if A is in row 0, then no one else can be in row 0 — so they must form a line in a different row. Since A must be **closer** than others, and only one person can be in row 0, **A must be in row 0**.

But row 0 is the audience row — can we place a dancer there?

✅ Yes — we interpret "audience" as **facing the stage**, so **row 0 is the front**, and dancers can stand **on row 0**, just not "in front" of the audience. So **row 0 is the front row** — A can be there.

Thus:

- A is in **row 0** (closest to audience)
- The other 7 dancers form a **horizontal line** (same row) — but they can't all be in row 0 (only one person can be in row 0). So they form a line in **row 1**, which is still close.

But the rule says: "dancers except for the lead dancer form a line parallel to the audience" — so **they must be in a horizontal line**, not necessarily in the same row as A.

So:

- A is in row 0 (closest)
- B–H form a **horizontal line** in row 1 (parallel to audience)

✅ This satisfies all constraints.

### 🔷 Formation 1 – Line Formation

```
Row 0: A
Row 1: B C D E F G H
Row 2–7: empty (all #)

Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
```

🟢 **Audience position**: Row 0 (facing down)

✅ A is in row 0 → closest to audience  
✅ All others form a horizontal line in row 1 → parallel to audience  
✅ All 8 people accounted for

---

## ✅ Formation 2: Circular Formation (Symmetrical, around center)

**Rule**: No specific rule given, so we create a distinct, balanced formation.

👉 A is at center (closest to audience), others form a circle or ring.

But to keep A close to audience, place A in row 1.

We can create a **circular formation** where A is at the center (row 3, column 3), and others form a ring around it.

But we want A to be **closer to audience** than others.

So, **A must be in row 0 or 1**.

Let’s place A in **row 1**, and others form a **ring** in rows 2–6, symmetrically.

But to keep it simple and distinct:

👉 A is in row 1, column 4 (near front)

Others form a **symmetrical ring** around the center (row 3, col 3), but only in rows 2–6.

To make it visually distinct and balanced:

- A at (1,4)
- Others in a circle: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,6), (4,1), (4,6), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)

Wait — that’s too many.

We only have 7 others.

Let’s pick a **compact circular ring** of 7 people.

Place A at (1,3)

Others form a ring: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — that’s 8 points.

We need only 7.

So pick 7 symmetric points.

Final ring:  
(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,7), (4,0), (4,7)

And A at (1,3)

All others are in rows 2–4, so farther from audience than A.

✅ A is in row 1 → closer than others

✅ Formation is circular and distinct

---

### 🔷 Formation 2 – Circular Ring

```
Row 0: # # # # # # # #
Row 1: # # # A # # # #
Row 2: # # # # # # # #
Row 3: # # # # # # # #
Row 4: # # # # # # # #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
```

**Actual placement**:

- A → (1,3)
- B → (2,1)
- C → (2,2)
- D → (2,3)
- E → (3,0)
- F → (3,7)
- G → (4,0)
- H → (4,7)

All others in rows 2–4 → farther than A

**Grid**:

```
Row 0: # # # # # # # #
Row 1: # # # A # # # #
Row 2: B C D # # # # #
Row 3: E # # # # # F #
Row 4: G # # # # # H #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
```

🟢 Audience: Row 0 (facing down)

✅ A is in row 1 → closer than all others  
✅ Formation is distinct (circular ring)

---

## ✅ Formation 3: Triangular Shape

**Rule**: Some dancers create a triangular shape.

👉 A must be in the closest row (row 0 or 1)

We can make a **triangle pointing toward the audience** — so apex at front.

Let’s build a **right triangle** with A at the top.

Place A at (0,3)

Then build a triangle with points:

- (0,3) — A
- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)

But that’s too many.

We need only 8 people.

Let’s make a **small triangle**:

- A at (0,3)
- B at (1,2)
- C at (1,3)
- D at (1,4)
- E at (2,2)
- F at (2,3)
- G at (2,4)
- H at (3,3)

This forms a **triangle with base at row 1–2**, apex at (0,3)

All others are in row 1 or 2 → farther than A

✅ A is in row 0 → closest to audience  
✅ Forms a triangular shape (three points: (0,3), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3)) — a

**Policy Proposal: Safeguarding Indigenous Cultural Heritage and Promoting Sustainable Development**

1. **Establish Co-Management Agreements**: Partner with Indigenous communities to co-govern natural resources and cultural sites. These agreements ensure that development projects align with traditional knowledge and practices, preserving cultural heritage while supporting sustainable resource use.

2. **Integrate Traditional Knowledge into Planning**: Mandate that all development plans—especially in agriculture, forestry, and tourism—include consultation with Indigenous elders and knowledge holders. This ensures cultural values are respected and ecological practices are incorporated for long-term sustainability.

3. **Fund Community-Led Initiatives**: Allocate dedicated, transparent funding for Indigenous-led projects in education, eco-tourism, and cultural preservation. These initiatives empower communities to manage their own development while safeguarding language, customs, and ancestral lands.

By centering Indigenous voices in decision-making, this policy balances cultural preservation with economic growth. It fosters equitable development, strengthens community resilience, and ensures that heritage is not merely protected but actively revitalized. Such a framework respects sovereignty, promotes environmental stewardship, and creates inclusive pathways for sustainable progress across regions.

Let's analyze the cross between two individuals using a **Punnett square** to determine the **genotypic and phenotypic ratios** of the offspring.

---

### 🌟 Parents:
- **Parent 1**: Heterozygous for two traits → **AaBb**
- **Parent 2**: Homozygous dominant for trait A, heterozygous for trait B → **AABb**

We are assuming **independent assortment** (Mendel's law of independent inheritance) for the two traits (A/a and B/b), and that both traits are **completely dominant**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the gametes each parent can produce

#### Parent 1 (AaBb)
Possible gametes:  
AB, Ab, aB, ab  
→ Each with equal probability (1/4)

#### Parent 2 (AABb)
Genotype: AA (homozygous dominant for A), Bb (heterozygous for B)  
Gametes:  
AB, Ab  
→ Because AA produces only A, and Bb produces B or b  
So gametes: AB and Ab (each 50% chance)

---

### Step 2: Set up the Punnett square

We will create a 4 × 2 grid (Parent 1 gametes × Parent 2 gametes):

|       | AB  | Ab  |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **AB** | AABB | AABb |
| **Ab** | AABb | AAbb |
| **aB** | AaBB | AaBb |
| **ab** | AaBb | Aabb |

Wait — we made a mistake in the setup. Parent 1 has **four** gametes: AB, Ab, aB, ab  
Parent 2 has **two** gametes: AB, Ab

So the correct Punnett square is:

|       | AB  | Ab  |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **AB** | AABB | AABb |
| **Ab** | AABb | AAbb |
| **aB** | AaBB | AaBb |
| **ab** | AaBb | Aabb |

✅ Now, list all offspring genotypes and count frequencies.

---

### Step 3: List all offspring genotypes and their frequencies

Each cell represents a unique genotype with equal probability (1/8 each, since 4 × 2 = 8 total combinations).

Let’s go through each:

1. **AABB** → from AB × AB → 1
2. **AABb** → from AB × Ab OR Ab × AB →  
   - AB × Ab → AABb  
   - Ab × AB → AABb  
   → 2 total  
3. **AAbb** → from Ab × Ab → 1  
4. **AaBB** → from aB × AB → 1  
5. **AaBb** → from aB × Ab OR ab × AB →  
   - aB × Ab → AaBb  
   - ab × AB → AaBb  
   → 2  
6. **Aabb** → from ab × Ab → 1  

Wait — let’s list all 8 combinations clearly:

| Parent 1 Gamete | Parent 2 Gamete | Offspring Genotype |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| AB              | AB               | AABB                 |
| AB              | Ab               | AABb                 |
| Ab              | AB               | AABb                 |
| Ab              | Ab               | AAbb                 |
| aB              | AB               | AaBB                 |
| aB              | Ab               | AaBb                 |
| ab              | AB               | AaBb                 |
| ab              | Ab               | Aabb                 |

Now, group by genotype:

| Genotype | Number of combinations | Frequency |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| AABB    | 1                      | 1/8       |
| AABb    | 2                      | 2/8 = 1/4 |
| AAbb    | 1                      | 1/8       |
| AaBB    | 1                      | 1/8       |
| AaBb    | 2                      | 2/8 = 1/4 |
| Aabb    | 1                      | 1/8       |

✅ So, **genotypic ratio**:

- AABB : AABb : AAbb : AaBB : AaBb : Aabb  
= **1 : 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1**

---

### Step 4: Determine phenotypic ratios

We assume **complete dominance**:

- Trait A: A is dominant → A_ (AA or Aa) = dominant phenotype  
- Trait B: B is dominant → B_ (BB or Bb) = dominant phenotype

So:

- **Dominant phenotype for both traits** → A_ B_  
- **Dominant for A, recessive for B** → A_ bb  
- **Recessive for A, dominant for B** → aa B_  
- **Recessive for both** → aa bb  

Let’s evaluate each genotype:

| Genotype | Phenotype (A/B) |
|---------|------------------|
| AABB    | Dominant, Dominant |
| AABb    | Dominant, Dominant |
| AAbb    | Dominant, Recessive |
| AaBB    | Dominant, Dominant |
| AaBb    | Dominant, Dominant |
| Aabb    | Dominant, Recessive |

Now, check for **aa** genotypes?  
→ None of the offspring have **aa** (since Parent 2 is AA, so all offspring get at least one A).  
So **all offspring have at least one A allele** → **all show dominant phenotype for trait A**

Now, for trait B:

- Genotypes with **B_** (BB or Bb):  
  → AABB, AABb, AaBB, AaBb → all have at least one B  
- Genotypes with **bb**:  
  → AAbb, Aabb

So:

- **Phenotype: Dominant A + Dominant B** → A_ B_  
  → Genotypes: AABB, AABb, AaBB, AaBb  
  → Count:  
    - AABB: 1  
    - AABb: 2  
    - AaBB: 1  
    - AaBb: 2  
    → Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **6**

- **Phenotype: Dominant A + Recessive B** → A_ bb  
  → Genotypes: AAbb (1), Aabb (1) → total = **2**

- **Phenotype: Recessive A + Dominant B** → aa B_ → **none** (no aa)  
- **Phenotype: Recessive A + Recessive B** → aa bb → **none**

✅ So phenotypic ratio:

- **Dominant (A) and Dominant (B)** : **6/8 = 3/4**  
- **Dominant (A) and Recessive (B)** : **2/8 = 1/4**

Thus, **phenotypic ratio** = **3 : 1**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

---

#### 📌 Genotypic Ratio:
- **AABB : AABb : AAbb : AaBB : AaBb : Aabb**  
= **1 : 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1**

#### 📌 Phenotypic Ratio:
- **Dominant for both traits : Dominant for A and recessive for B**  
= **3 : 1**

---

### 🔍 Explanation Summary:

- All offspring inherit at least one **A** allele from Parent 2 (AA), so **no recessive phenotype for trait A**.
- For trait B, the cross is between Bb (Parent 1) and Bb (Parent 2) → but Parent 2 is Bb, Parent 1 is Bb → actually, Parent 2 is **Bb**, Parent 1 is **Bb**, so the B/b trait is **independent** and follows a standard monohybrid cross.
- The **B trait** shows a 3:1 dominant:recessive ratio in offspring.
- Since **A is always dominant**, the only phenotypic variation is in trait B.
- Therefore, overall phenotypic ratio is **3 (dominant A and dominant B) : 1 (dominant A and recessive B)**.

---

### 📚 Note:
Even though both parents are heterozygous for one trait, the **genotypic ratio** is not symmetric due to the different genotypes of the parents. The Punnett square clearly shows the combinations.

---

✅ **Final Answer Summary**:

> **Genotypic ratio**: 1 AABB : 2 AABb : 1 AAbb : 1 AaBB : 2 AaBb : 1 Aabb  
> **Phenotypic ratio**: 3 (dominant for both traits) : 1 (dominant for A, recessive for B)

This cross demonstrates how dominance and parental genotypes influence offspring outcomes, even when multiple traits are involved.

The word **"oblique"** has a rich and fascinating etymological history that traces back to ancient languages and evolves through linguistic development into its modern English form.

### Origins and Etymology:

1. **Latin Roots**:
   - The word *oblique* originates from the Latin word **"obliquus"**, which means "slanted," "tilted," or "inclined at an angle."
   - *Obliquus* is derived from the prefix **"ob-"**, meaning "toward," "against," or "beside," combined with the root **"culus"**, which relates to "slope" or "inclination."
   - The root *ob-* itself comes from the Latin *ob*, meaning "against" or "beside," and *cul-* or *culus* is a variant of *cul* meaning "to bend" or "to turn."
   - Thus, *obliquus* literally means "turned aside" or "inclined to the side," which aligns with the modern meaning of something slanted or not directly facing.

2. **Old French Influence**:
   - The Latin *obliquus* was adopted into Old French as *oblique*, preserving the same meaning.
   - It was used in medieval French texts to describe angles, directions, or positions that were not straight or perpendicular.

3. **Entry into Middle English**:
   - The word entered Middle English in the 14th century via Old French influence.
   - In early English usage, it was primarily used in geometric or architectural contexts to describe a slant or angle not at 90 degrees.

4. **Expansion of Meaning**:
   - Over time, the meaning of *oblique* broadened beyond geometry.
   - In the 16th and 17th centuries, it began to be used metaphorically in English to describe something indirect, ambiguous, or not straightforward—such as an oblique reference or an oblique comment.
   - This shift reflects the idea of being "slanted" or "not direct," much like a slanted line that doesn't face directly toward a point.

5. **Modern Usage**:
   - Today, *oblique* is used in both literal and figurative senses:
     - **Literal**: Describing a line or surface that is not perpendicular to a surface (e.g., an oblique angle).
     - **Figurative**: Describing something indirect, subtle, or evasive (e.g., "He made an oblique reference to the issue").
   - It is also used in fields such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy to describe indirect communication or perspectives.

### Historical Examples:
- In geometry: "The diagonal of a rectangle forms an oblique angle with the horizontal."
- In literature or conversation: "She gave an oblique answer to the question, hinting at something without saying it outright."

### Summary:
The word **oblique** has deep roots in Latin, derived from *obliquus*, meaning "slanted" or "inclined to the side." It passed through Old French into Middle English and evolved from a geometric term to a versatile word used in both literal and figurative contexts. Its journey reflects how language adapts to convey both physical and abstract ideas—showing that a simple word about angles can describe complex human behaviors like indirectness and subtlety.

Thus, *oblique* stands as a testament to the power of language to bridge physical reality and human expression.

And feel the pulse of every living thing.  
No death can steal the light that dances free,  
Nor silence claim the laughter that we bring.  
For love, like fire, doth burn through all the years—  
And life, though brief, is endless in its song.  
So let me live, and love, and breathe, and see—  
For joy is truth, and truth is life’s true tongue.

Yes, **Question1 and Question2 are duplicates** in essence, though they are phrased differently and cover slightly different aspects.

---

### Why they are duplicates:

Both questions are centered around understanding the **differences between threading and multiprocessing in Python**, particularly:

- The **advantages of multiprocessing over threading**
- The **practical differences** in usage (e.g., how to manage parallel jobs, limits on concurrency)
- **When to use one over the other**
- **Common pitfalls** (like pickling errors)
- **Lack of clarity in documentation** for complex use cases

While Question1 is more focused on the **theoretical advantages** (like bypassing GIL), and Question2 includes **practical implementation issues** (e.g., managing a queue of jobs, limiting parallel processes), the **core intent and underlying topics are the same**.

---

### Key Overlaps:

| Topic | Covered in Both Questions |
|------|---------------------------|
| Difference between `threading.Thread()` and `multiprocessing.Process()` | ✅ |
| Why multiprocessing might be better than threading (GIL, performance) | ✅ |
| When to use which | ✅ |
| Challenges in using them for complex tasks | ✅ |
| Pickling errors and documentation gaps | ✅ |

---

### Minor Differences:

- **Question1** is more theoretical and concise.
- **Question2** is more detailed and includes specific implementation concerns (queue management, resource limits), which adds practical depth.

However, these differences do not change the fundamental nature of the questions — they are both seeking a **comprehensive understanding of when and how to use threading vs multiprocessing in Python**, especially in real-world, complex scenarios.

---

### Conclusion:

✅ **Yes, these questions are duplicates** — they are asking the same core question from slightly different angles. A single, well-structured answer addressing both theoretical and practical aspects would satisfy both.

**Mental Exercise: The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique**

**How to Use It:**

The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique is a simple, evidence-based mental exercise designed to help individuals manage anxiety in the moment. It works by pulling attention away from anxious thoughts and redirecting it to the present environment through sensory engagement. This helps reduce the intensity of anxiety by activating the brain’s parasympathetic nervous system—responsible for calming the body.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **5 Things You Can See**  
   Pause and look around. Name five distinct things you can see.  
   *Examples:* A red chair, a window with trees outside, a book on the table, a clock, a plant.  
   *Purpose:* Engages the visual sense, anchoring attention in the present.

2. **4 Things You Can Touch (or Feel)**  
   Notice four physical sensations you can feel in your body.  
   *Examples:* The texture of your clothes, the weight of your phone, the coolness of your chair, the pressure of your feet on the floor.  
   *Purpose:* Activates the tactile sense, helping to ground your physical experience.

3. **3 Things You Can Hear**  
   Listen and identify three sounds around you.  
   *Examples:* Traffic, birds chirping, distant voices, your own breathing.  
   *Purpose:* Engages the auditory sense, helping to reduce mental rumination.

4. **2 Things You Can Smell**  
   Notice two scents in the air.  
   *Examples:* Coffee, fresh air, cleaning products, or even your own skin.  
   *Purpose:* Stimulates the olfactory sense, which is closely linked to memory and emotion regulation.

5. **1 Thing You Can Taste**  
   Focus on one taste you can detect—either something you’ve recently eaten or a natural sensation like the taste of your breath or saliva.  
   *Examples:* The mint from your toothpaste, the sweetness of your last bite of fruit, or just the sensation of your tongue.  
   *Purpose:* Triggers a strong sensory memory, helping to shift focus from internal distress to immediate experience.

**How It Works:**

Anxiety often arises from a loop of negative thoughts and future-focused worries, which can trigger a physiological "fight-or-flight" response. The 5-4-3-2-1 technique interrupts this cycle by:

- **Shifting focus from the mind to the body and environment**, reducing the power of anxious thoughts.
- **Activating the somatic (body-based) awareness**, which helps regulate the autonomic nervous system.
- **Creating a sense of presence**, allowing individuals to reconnect with their immediate reality instead of getting caught in rumination.
- **Reducing the amygdala’s (fear center) overactivity** through sensory input, which calms the stress response.

This exercise is especially effective during moments of panic, overwhelming emotions, or when someone feels "frozen" by anxiety. It doesn’t eliminate anxiety—it simply helps the person regain control and return to a state of calm through grounded awareness.

**Tips for Use:**
- Practice it daily as a mindfulness habit to build resilience.
- Use it when you notice rising anxiety, even if it's mild.
- Combine it with deep breathing for even greater effect.

**Note:** While the 5-4-3-2-1 technique is not a substitute for professional treatment for clinical anxiety disorders, it is a powerful, accessible tool for self-regulation and emotional resilience.

By regularly practicing this mental exercise, individuals can develop a stronger sense of self-awareness and a more balanced relationship with their emotions—making anxiety less overwhelming and more manageable.

We are asked to **arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4** in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 — that is, we are permuting the numbers 1 through 4.

We need to **count how many of these permutations satisfy the condition** that **each number in a position is different from the position number**.

In other words, for a permutation (a, b, c, d), we want:

- a ≠ 1  
- b ≠ 2  
- c ≠ 3  
- d ≠ 4  

This is a classic problem of **derangements**.

---

### Step 1: Total number of permutations
There are 4! = 24 total permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

We will now **enumerate all 24 permutations** and check which ones satisfy the condition that **no number is in its "natural" position** (i.e., no number equals its position index).

We'll list each permutation as (pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4), and check if:

- pos1 ≠ 1  
- pos2 ≠ 2  
- pos3 ≠ 3  
- pos4 ≠ 4  

We will go through all permutations systematically.

### Step 2: Exhaustive Enumeration

We list all permutations of {1,2,3,4} in lexicographic order and check the condition.

### 📝 Final Answer:
**Estimated total cost of supplies: $77**

> ⚠️ **Note**: The original list includes items (like ice-maker and aquarium pumps) that are not standard or effective for a water chiller. A true DIY water chiller typically uses a refrigeration unit, heat exchanger, and a cooling loop. This estimate assumes a simplified, low-cost DIY setup focused on circulation and temperature control, not actual chiller function. For true water chilling, a more robust and expensive system (e.g., using a refrigerator with a heat exchanger) would be needed.

**Lecture Notes: Quantum Mechanics – Schrödinger Equation and Dirac Equation**

---

### **1. Schrödinger Equation**

The Schrödinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.

- **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)**  
  Describes the evolution of the wave function \( \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \) over time.  
  \[
  i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
  \]  
  Where:  
  - \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,  
  - \( m \) is the particle mass,  
  - \( V(\mathbf{r}) \) is the potential energy,  
  - \( \nabla^2 \) is the Laplacian operator.

- **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)**  
  Used for stationary states (energy eigenstates).  
  \[
  \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})
  \]  
  Solving this yields energy levels \( E \) and spatial wave functions \( \psi(\mathbf{r}) \).

- **Interpretation**  
  The wave function \( \psi \) is a complex-valued probability amplitude; \( |\psi|^2 \) gives the probability density of finding a particle at position \( \mathbf{r} \).

- **Limitations**  
  Does not account for relativistic effects, spin, or antimatter. Applicable only for low-energy, non-relativistic systems.

---

### **2. Dirac Equation**

The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that incorporates special relativity and describes particles with spin-1/2 (e.g., electrons).

- **Relativistic Foundation**  
  Combines quantum mechanics with Einstein’s special relativity, resolving inconsistencies in the Schrödinger equation at high energies.

- **Form of the Dirac Equation**  
  \[
  \left( i\hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - mc \right) \psi = 0
  \]  
  Where:  
  - \( \gamma^\mu \) are the Dirac gamma matrices (4×4 matrices satisfying \( \{\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu\} = 2g^{\mu\nu} \)),  
  - \( \partial_\mu \) is the partial derivative with respect to spacetime coordinates,  
  - \( m \) is the particle mass,  
  - \( c \) is the speed of light.

- **Predicts Spin and Antiparticles**  
  Naturally incorporates spin-1/2 via the gamma matrices and predicts the existence of antiparticles (e.g., positrons).

- **Solution Structure**  
  The wave function \( \psi \) is a 4-component spinor, representing particle and antiparticle states with spin up/down projections.

- **Advantages over Schrödinger Equation**  
  Consistent with Lorentz invariance, explains fine structure of atomic spectra, and provides a foundation for quantum field theory.

---

**Summary**  
- Schrödinger equation: Non-relativistic, describes wave functions and energy levels.  
- Dirac equation: Relativistic, includes spin and predicts antimatter.  
Both are foundational in quantum theory, with Dirac extending Schrödinger’s framework to high-energy physics.

Her art reflects surface-level eco-activism—photos of plastic waste, but no real change.\n\n2. **Call to Adventure**  \n   A viral video of a dying coral reef in the Pacific, created by a young climate scientist, reaches Maya’s feed. The video includes a haunting message: *“The ocean remembers. It is time to listen.”* She is struck by its authenticity and emotional weight.\n\n3. **Refusal of the Call**  \n   Maya dismisses the video as another performative environmental trend. She argues with her skeptical friends: “It’s just a photo. No one can fix the planet with art.” She retreats into her screen-based world.\n\n4. **Meeting with the Mentor**  \n   A reclusive marine biologist, Dr. Lin, contacts Maya through a digital forum. She shares personal stories of witnessing coral die-offs and the emotional toll of scientific despair. Lin tells Maya: *“You don’t need to save the world. You just need to witness it—and then tell the truth.”*\n\n5. **Crossing the First Threshold**  \n   Maya decides to travel to a remote Pacific island to document the reef’s decline firsthand. She leaves behind her comfort, her job, and her social media following. This journey marks her first real step into the unknown.\n\n---\n\n**ACT II: INITIATION**  \n*Maya confronts fears, forms unexpected alliances, and faces personal and environmental trials that force her to evolve beyond her old self.*\n\n6. **Tests, Allies, and Enemies**  \n   On the island, Maya faces physical and emotional challenges: language barriers, local distrust, and the harsh reality of climate damage. She meets a young fisher girl, Aiko, who teaches her traditional ecological knowledge. A skeptical government agent, Mr. Vargas, warns her that her documentation could endanger the community.\n\n7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave**  \n   Maya discovers a hidden underwater cave where a rare, genetically preserved coral species still thrives. This discovery becomes a symbol of hope—but also a danger. She realizes the reef’s survival depends on a balance she cannot control.\n\n8. **The Ordeal**  \n   A sudden storm floods the island. Aiko’s family is threatened, and Maya must choose: destroy the cave to save lives, or risk losing the coral. In a moment of crisis, she chooses to protect the coral, even as it means sacrificing the immediate safety of her allies.\n\n9. **Reward**  \n   Maya gains a deep sense of purpose. Her art transforms—no longer performative, but rooted in lived experience. She creates a piece titled *“Breath of the Deep”*, which captures both loss and resilience. She also forms a bond with Aiko and begins a community-led conservation initiative.\n\n---\n\n**ACT III: RETURN**  \n*Maya returns to the world, changed, carrying a new truth and a responsibility to act.*\n\n10. **The Road Back**  \n   Maya returns to her city, where she is met with disbelief. Her art is met with both criticism and acclaim. Some see it as naïve; others see it as revolutionary. She struggles to find her place in a world that still values convenience over truth.\n\n11. **The Resurrection**  \n   When a major corporation plans to exploit the island’s resources, Maya publicly shares her story. She stands on a rooftop with Aiko and a small group of youth activists, delivering a raw, unfiltered speech. She doesn’t offer solutions—she offers testimony. The audience is stunned.

**Title:** *The Weight of Tomorrow*  
**Generation:** Millennials and Gen Z (ages 18–35) navigating identity, climate crisis, and digital isolation  

---

**ACT I: DEPARTURE**  
*The protagonist begins in a familiar, yet increasingly unstable world—where the future feels uncertain and personal dreams are overshadowed by societal pressures.*

1. **Ordinary World**  
   Maya, a 24-year-old environmental artist in a coastal city, lives a routine life: working remote from a tiny apartment, scrolling through social media, and feeling disconnected from both nature and people. Her art reflects surface-level eco-activism—photos of plastic waste, but no real change.

2. **Call to Adventure**  
   A viral video of a dying coral reef in the Pacific, created by a young climate scientist, reaches Maya’s feed. The video includes a haunting message: *“The ocean remembers. It is time to listen.”* She is struck by its authenticity and emotional weight.

3. **Refusal of the Call**  
   Maya dismisses the video as another performative environmental trend. She argues with her skeptical friends: “It’s just a photo. No one can fix the planet with art.” She retreats into her screen-based world.

4. **Meeting with the Mentor**  
   A reclusive marine biologist, Dr. Lin, contacts Maya through a digital forum. She shares personal stories of witnessing coral die-offs and the emotional toll of scientific despair. Lin tells Maya: *“You don’t need to save the world. You just need to witness it—and then tell the truth.”*

5. **Crossing the First Threshold**  
   Maya decides to travel to a remote Pacific island to document the reef’s decline firsthand. She leaves behind her comfort, her job, and her social media following. This journey marks her first real step into the unknown.

---

**ACT II: INITIATION**  
*Maya confronts fears, forms unexpected alliances, and faces personal and environmental trials that force her to evolve beyond her old self.*

6. **Tests, Allies, and Enemies**  
   On the island, Maya faces physical and emotional challenges: language barriers, local distrust, and the harsh reality of climate damage. She meets a young fisher girl, Aiko, who teaches her traditional ecological knowledge. A skeptical government agent, Mr. Vargas, warns her that her documentation could endanger the community.

7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave**  
   Maya discovers a hidden underwater cave where a rare, genetically preserved coral species still thrives. This discovery becomes a symbol of hope—but also a danger. She realizes the reef’s survival depends on a balance she cannot control.

8. **The Ordeal**  
   A sudden storm floods the island. Aiko’s family is threatened, and Maya must choose: destroy the cave to save lives, or risk losing the coral. In a moment of crisis, she chooses to protect the coral, even as it means sacrificing the immediate safety of her allies.

9. **Reward**  
   Maya gains a deep sense of purpose. Her art transforms—no longer performative, but rooted in lived experience. She creates a piece titled *“Breath of the Deep”*, which captures both loss and resilience. She also forms a bond with Aiko and begins a community-led conservation initiative.

---

**ACT III: RETURN**  
*Maya returns to the world, changed, carrying a new truth and a responsibility to act.*

10. **The Road Back**  
   Maya returns to her city, where she is met with disbelief. Her art is met with both criticism and acclaim. Some see it as naïve; others see it as revolutionary. She struggles to find her place in a world that still values convenience over truth.

11. **The Resurrection**  
   When a major corporation plans to exploit the island’s resources, Maya publicly shares her story. She stands on a rooftop with Aiko and a small group of youth activists, delivering a raw, unfiltered speech. She doesn’t offer solutions—she offers testimony. The audience is stunned. The corporation pauses. A new movement begins.

12. **Return with the Elixir**  
   Maya returns not with a magic potion, but with a *new way of seeing*. She shares her journey in a documentary, teaches art workshops in schools, and becomes a bridge between science and storytelling. The “elixir” is not a cure, but a shift in consciousness: *the power of witnessing, of listening, of being present in the face of loss and hope.*

---

**Themes:**  
- The hero’s journey as a personal and collective transformation  
- Climate anxiety and the role of art in truth-telling  
- Inter-generational healing and the power of youth voices  

**Tone:** Realistic, emotionally raw, hopeful—blending environmental urgency with intimate human connection.  

**Audience Resonance:** Speaks directly to millennials and Gen Z who feel caught between digital detachment and urgent global crises—offering a narrative of agency through authenticity.

The given code has several bugs and is syntactically incorrect. Let's identify and fix them step by step.

---

### ❌ Original Code:
```python
for i in range(10)
    print(Answer is:)
    print(i)
```

---

### 🔍 Bugs Identified:

1. **Syntax Error**: The `for` loop is missing a colon (`:`) at the end of the line.
2. **Incorrect string**: `print(Answer is:)` — this is not valid Python syntax. It should be `print("Answer is:")` to properly format a string.
3. **Missing indentation**: In Python, the body of a loop must be properly indented (typically 4 spaces or 1 tab).
4. **Logic issue**: The loop prints "Answer is:" and the value of `i` for each iteration, which is fine, but the message "Answer is:" is not clearly tied to the value of `i`.

---

### ✅ Fixed and Improved Version:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Answer is: {i}")
```

---

### ✅ Explanation of Fixes:

- Added the missing colon after `range(10)`.
- Fixed the string formatting: used `f"Answer is: {i}"` to properly insert the value of `i`.
- Properly indented the print statement.
- The loop now correctly iterates from 0 to 9 and prints each value.

---

### ✅ Output:
```
Answer is: 0
Answer is: 1
Answer is: 2
Answer is: 3
Answer is: 4
Answer is: 5
Answer is: 6
Answer is: 7
Answer is: 8
Answer is: 9
```

This is now syntactically correct, logically sound, and readable.

✅ Final Answer:  
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(f"Answer is: {i}")
```

We are given a pattern: **H_AR_**

We need to identify all words that match this pattern.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pattern
The pattern is: **H_AR_**

Let’s break it down by positions:

- 1st letter: **H**
- 2nd letter: **A**
- 3rd letter: **R**
- 4th letter: **_** (any letter)
- 5th letter: **_** (any letter)

So, the word must be 5 letters long, starting with **H**, followed by **A**, then **R**, and then two unknown letters.

Pattern: **H A R _ _**

So, we are looking for 5-letter words that follow the form: **H-A-R-X-Y**, where X and Y are any letters.

---

### Step 2: Search for real English words matching H-A-R-X-Y

We can think of known words that start with "HAR".

Examples of words starting with "HAR":

- **Harbor** → H-A-R-B-O-R → 6 letters → too long
- **Harsh** → H-A-R-S-H → 5 letters → matches pattern: H-A-R-S-H → yes!
- **Harsh** fits: H-A-R-S-H → positions: 1:H, 2:A, 3:R, 4:S, 5:H → matches H_A_R_ _

Another:
- **Harsh** ✅
- **Harshness** → too long
- **Harpy** → H-A-R-P-Y → 5 letters → H-A-R-P-Y → fits pattern ✅
- **Harsh** ✅
- **Harsh** again? Let's check others.

List of 5-letter words starting with HAR:

1. **Harsh** → H-A-R-S-H → ✅
2. **Harpy** → H-A-R-P-Y → ✅
3. **Harsh** (again)
4. **Harsh** is the only one with double S? Let's check dictionary.

Other possibilities:

- **Harsh** ✅
- **Harpy** ✅
- **Harm** → H-A-R-M → only 4 letters → too short
- **Hare** → H-A-R-E → 4 letters → too short
- **Harsh** → 5 letters → valid
- **Harsh** → yes
- **Harsh** → is it the only one?

What about:

- **Harsh** ✅
- **Harpy** ✅
- **Harsh** (again)
- **Harsh** — is there a word like "hark"? H-A-R-K → 4 letters → no
- **Harsh**, **Harpy**, **Harsh** — any others?

Check:

- **Harsh** → valid
- **Harpy** → valid
- **Harsh** → valid
- **Harsh** — is "hars" a word? Not really.
- **Harsh** — is "hars" a word? No.
- **Harsh** — only one with S-H?

What about:

- **Harsh** ✅
- **Harpy** ✅
- **Harsh** — any others?

Let’s check a word like **Harm** → too short.

**Harsh**, **Harpy**, **Harsh** — is there a word like **Harsh** or **Harsh**?

Wait — is **Harsh** the only one?

Actually, consider:

- **Harsh** → H-A-R-S-H → ✅
- **Harpy** → H-A-R-P-Y → ✅
- **Harsh** → same as above
- **Harsh** — no other common 5-letter words starting with HAR?

Try:

- **Harsh** → yes
- **Harpy** → yes
- **Harsh** → yes

Are there others?

- **Harsh** — is there a word like "hars" + "t"? "harts"? H-A-R-T-S → H-A-R-T-S → 5 letters → H-A-R-T-S → yes!

Is **harts** a word?

Yes — "harts" is a noun (male deer) → H-A-R-T-S → fits pattern: H-A-R-T-S → ✅

So now we have:

1. **Harsh**
2. **Harpy**
3. **Harts**

Any others?

- **Harsh** — already have
- **Harsh** — no
- **Harsh** — no
- **Harsh** — no

What about **Harse**? Not a word.
**Harsh** — no
**Harsh** — no

**Harsh** — only common ones?

Check: **Harsh**, **Harpy**, **Harts**

Any others?

- **Harsh** — is there a word "hars" + "e"? "harse"? Not a word.
- **Harsh** — "harsh" is the only one with S-H
- **Harsh** — "harpy" is a word
- **Harts** — yes

What about **Harsh** — is there a word "harsh" with different letters?

No.

Another: **Harsh** — no.

So, valid 5-letter words matching **H_A_R_ _**:

- **Harsh**
- **Harpy**
- **Harts**

Are there any others?

Try: **Harsh**, **Harpy**, **Harts**

What about **Harsh** — no

**Harsh** — no

**Harsh** — no

So, likely only these three.

---

### Final Answer:

✅ Words matching the pattern **H_A_R_ _**:

- **Harsh**
- **Harpy**
- **Harts**

---

✅ **Answer: Harsh, Harpy, Harts**

Removes unwanted characters (such as punctuation, extra whitespace, and control characters) and normalizes the text by converting it to lowercase. This method is useful for preparing raw text input for further analysis.

**Parameters**  
- `text` (`str`): The input text string to be cleaned. Must not be `None` or `NaN`. If empty, returns an empty string.

**Returns**  
- `str`: A cleaned version of the input text with all characters converted to lowercase, extra whitespaces removed, and punctuation stripped.

**Example Usage**  
```python
processor = TextProcessor()
cleaned = processor.clean_text("Hello, World!  This is a test...  ")
print(cleaned)  # Output: "hello world this is a test"
```

---

### 2. `extract_keywords(text: str, min_length: int = 3, max_length: int = 10) -> list[str]`

**Purpose**  
Extracts potential keywords from a given text based on word length and frequency. This method identifies words that fall within a specified length range and are likely to be meaningful content.

**Parameters**  
- `text` (`str`): The input text from which to extract keywords. Must not be `None`.  
- `min_length` (`int`, default=3): The minimum number of characters a word must have to be considered. Must be ≥ 1.  
- `max_length` (`int`, default=10): The maximum number of characters a word must have to be considered. Must be ≥ `min_length`.

**Returns**  
- `list[str]`: A list of strings representing the extracted keywords, sorted alphabetically. Returns an empty list if no valid words are found.

**Example Usage**  
```python
processor = TextProcessor()
keywords = processor.extract_keywords("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", min_length=4, max_length=8)
print(keywords)  # Output: ['brown', 'jumps', 'quick', 'lazy']
```

---

### 3. `to_title_case(text: str) -> str`

**Purpose**  
Converts a given text string to title case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized and the rest are lowercase. This is useful for formatting text for display or user-facing content.

**Parameters**  
- `text` (`str`): The input text to convert. Must not be `None`. If empty, returns an empty string.

**Returns**  
- `str`: The input text converted to title case.

**Example Usage**  
```python
processor = TextProcessor()
title_case_text = processor.to_title_case("hello world from python")
print(title_case_text)  # Output: "Hello World From Python"
```

---

## Sample Usage (Complete Example)

```python
# Initialize the TextProcessor
processor = TextProcessor()

# Example 1: Clean text
raw_text = "  Hello,  World!  How are you?  "
cleaned_text = processor.clean_text(raw_text)
print("Cleaned text:", cleaned_text)

# Example 2: Extract keywords
keywords = processor.extract_keywords(cleaned_text, min_length=3, max_length=8)
print("Extracted keywords:", keywords)

# Example 3: Convert to title case
title_text = processor.to_title_case(cleaned_text)
print("Title case text:", title_text)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Cleaned text: hello world how are you
Extracted keywords: ['how', 'are', 'you']
Title case text: Hello World How Are You
```

---

## Notes

- All methods are designed to handle edge cases such as empty strings or invalid inputs gracefully.
- The class assumes that input text is in UTF-8 encoding and does not validate external data sources.
- For production use, consider integrating with external libraries (e.g., `nltk`, `spacy`) for more advanced keyword extraction.

Sure! Below is a **dataset of 5 data points** in the format `(X1, X2, Y)`, where:

- `X1` and `X2` are independent variables  
- `Y` is the dependent variable  
- The relationship between `X1`, `X2`, and `Y` is **linear and deterministic** (so that `Y` can be accurately predicted using a linear regression model)

---

### ✅ Generated Dataset:

| X1 | X2 | Y  |
|----|----|----|
| 1  | 2  | 5  |
| 2  | 3  | 8  |
| 3  | 4  | 11 |
| 4  | 5  | 14 |
| 5  | 6  | 17 |

---

### 🔍 Explanation of the Relationship:

We can see that:
- `Y = 3*X1 + 2*X2 - 1`

Let’s verify:
- For (1,2): `3(1) + 2(2) - 1 = 3 + 4 - 1 = 6` ❌ → Wait, doesn't match Y=5

Oops — let's **correct** and ensure the values follow a **true linear relationship**.

Let’s define a clean linear model:  
**Y = 2*X1 + 3*X2 - 1**

Now verify:

| X1 | X2 | Y = 2X1 + 3X2 - 1 |
|----|----|-------------------|
| 1  | 2  | 2(1) + 3(2) - 1 = 2 + 6 - 1 = 7 ❌ (we want Y=5)  

We need to match the actual data. Let's **construct a dataset where Y is perfectly linear in X1 and X2**.

---

### ✅ Corrected & Verified Dataset (with perfect linear relationship):

Let’s define:  
**Y = 1.5*X1 + 2.0*X2 + 1**

Now generate 5 points:

| X1 | X2 | Y = 1.5X1 + 2.0X2 + 1 |
|----|----|------------------------|
| 1  | 1  | 1.5(1) + 2(1) + 1 = 4.5 |
| 2  | 3  | 1.5(2) + 2(3) + 1 = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 |
| 3  | 4  | 1.5(3) + 2(4) + 1 = 4.5 + 8 + 1 = 13.5 |
| 4  | 5  | 1.5(4) + 2(5) + 1 = 6 + 10 + 1 = 17 |
| 5  | 6  | 1.5(5) + 2(6) + 1 = 7.5 + 12 + 1 = 20.5 |

We can round to **one decimal** for simplicity.

---

### ✅ Final Dataset (Rounded to 1 decimal):

| X1 | X2 | Y   |
|----|----|-----|
| 1.0 | 1.0 | 4.5 |
| 2.0 | 3.0 | 10.0 |
| 3.0 | 4.0 | 13.5 |
| 4.0 | 5.0 | 17.0 |
| 5.0 | 6.0 | 20.5 |

✅ This dataset satisfies the requirement that **Y can be accurately predicted** using a linear combination of X1 and X2.

---

## 📈 Linear Regression Model

We now build a **simple linear regression model** to predict Y from X1 and X2.

### Model Equation (to be learned):

$$
\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X1 + b_2 X2
$$

We will compute the coefficients using **ordinary least squares (OLS)**.

---

### Step 1: Input Data (in matrix form)

Let’s define:

- $ X = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 3 & 1 \\
1 & 4 & 1 \\
1 & 5 & 1 \\
1 & 6 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} $ → Actually, we need to include the intercept.

Actually, the design matrix should be:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & X1 & X2 \\
1 & X1 & X2 \\
1 & X1 & X2 \\
1 & X1 & X2 \\
1 & X1 & X2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1.0 & 1.0 \\
1 & 2.0 & 3.0 \\
1 & 3.0 & 4.0 \\
1 & 4.0 & 5.0 \\
1 & 5.0 & 6.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
4.5 \\
10.0 \\
13.5 \\
17.0 \\
20.5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute Regression Coefficients

We solve:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y
$$

Let’s compute it step-by-step.

#### Matrix $ X^T X $:

$$
X^T X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 15 & 20 \\
15 & 55 & 75 \\
20 & 75 & 105 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Matrix $ X^T Y $:

$$
X^T Y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
4.5 + 10.0 + 13.5 + 17.0 + 20.5 \\
1(4.5) + 2(10.0) + 3(13.5) + 4(17.0) + 5(20.5) \\
1(1.0) + 3(3.0) + 4(4.0) + 5(5.0) + 6(6.0) \\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
65.5 \\
4.5 + 20.0 + 40.5 + 68.0 + 102.5 \\
1 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
65.5 \\
235.5 \\
87 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now solve:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 \\
b_1 \\
b_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y
$$

We now compute the inverse of $ X^T X $:

$$
X^T X = 
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 15 & 20 \\
15 & 55 & 75 \\
20 & 75 & 105 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can verify this matrix is **singular** or not?

Check determinant:

Using a calculator or row reduction:

Let’s compute determinant:

$$
\text{det} = 5(55 \cdot 105 - 75 \cdot 75) - 15(15 \cdot 105 - 75 \cdot 20) + 20(15 \cdot 75 - 55 \cdot 20)
$$

Compute each term:

- $ 55 \cdot 105 = 5775 $
- $ 75 \cdot 75 = 5625 $
- $ 5775 - 5625 = 150 $
- $ 5 \cdot 150 = 750 $

- $ 15 \cdot 105 = 1575 $
- $ 75 \cdot 20 = 1500 $
- $ 1575 - 1500 = 75 $
- $ 15 \cdot 75 = 1125 $

- $ 15 \cdot 75 = 1125 $
- $ 55 \cdot 20 = 1100 $
- $ 1125 - 1100 = 25 $
- $ 20 \cdot 25 = 500 $

Now sum:

$$
\text{det} = 750 - 15(75) + 20(25) = 750 - 1125 + 500 = 125
$$

✅ Determinant = 125 ≠ 0 → Invertible.

Now compute inverse (or use known values from the true model).

- 1 medium onion, finely chopped (use frying pan)  
- 3 garlic cloves, minced (use frying pan)  
- 1 cup diced zucchini (use frying pan)  
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (use frying pan)  
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)  

---

**Step-by-Step Preparation:**  

1. **Boil pasta in stockpot**  
   Add 4 liters of water to the stockpot. Bring to a boil, then add the spaghetti. Cook according to package instructions until al dente (about 8–10 minutes). Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.  

2. **Sauté vegetables in frying pan**  
   Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in the frying pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté for 3–4 minutes until soft. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in diced zucchini and cook for 5 minutes until tender.  

3. **Mix sauce and herbs**  
   Remove from heat. Stir in chopped fresh parsley. Let cool slightly.  

4. **Combine pasta and sauce**  
   Drain the cooked spaghetti and add it directly to the frying pan with the vegetable mixture. Toss well to coat. If needed, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen the texture.  

5. **Serve and garnish**  
   Serve hot, topped with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese (if using).

**1) Physical and Chemical Properties**

Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a white, crystalline solid with a high melting point and excellent solubility in water.  
*Physical properties (three adjectives):*  
- **Colorless** (appears as a pure white crystalline powder or granules)  
- **Brittle** (crystalline structure breaks under mechanical stress)  
- **Hygroscopic** (absorbs moisture from the air, especially in humid environments)

Chemically, sodium chloride is highly stable under normal conditions. It dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions when dissolved in water, forming a neutral solution. It is not reactive with most common acids, bases, or oxidizing agents under ambient conditions. The compound has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol and a density of approximately 2.16 g/cm³.

**2) Potential Hazards**

Sodium chloride is generally considered non-hazardous under normal handling conditions.  
- **Health hazards:** Ingestion of large quantities may lead to electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hypernatremia), particularly in individuals with compromised kidney function.  
- **Environmental hazards:** High concentrations in water bodies can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by altering salinity.  
- **Fire and explosion hazards:** No flammability or explosivity.  
- **Reactivity:** Does not react with water or air to produce hazardous gases or vapors.  
- **Toxicity:** Acute oral toxicity is low (LD50 > 5000 mg/kg in rats). Chronic exposure to high dietary intake may contribute to hypertension or cardiovascular issues in susceptible individuals.

What golden hush do forests weave,  
A tapestry of sunlight's breath?  
Do leaves like emerald sighs,  
Or dapple the sky with soft, drifting death?  

Does the wind, a whispered bard,  
Unravel secrets through the pines?  
Does every rustle, crack, and hush,  
Carry a language only birds know in their lines?  

Do rivers hum in silver tongues,  
A lullaby beneath the moon?  
Do streams, like silver-threaded sighs,  
Glide through the moss with quiet cries?  

Can the brook's soft chime outlive the dawn,  
Or does it vanish like a dream?  
Can the owl’s call pierce the hush,  
And speak of ancient, starlit streams?  

What does the wind ask of the trees,  
When it dances through the willows’ hair?  
Do the cedars hum in secret tones,  
Or do they listen to the stars’ bare air?  

What does the mountain whisper to the sky,  
When thunder cracks like a sleeping king?  
Do the peaks breathe in slow, solemn tones,  
Or do they dream of rivers long?  

Can silence sing when all is still,  
And every leaf a note in flight?  
Can the earth, in stillness, hold  
A symphony of breath and light?  

Oh, why do I weep at the dawn's first blush,  
When every petal opens like a prayer?  
Why does the breeze steal my heart,  
And leave me trembling in the air?  

Why do I long to be a root,  
Deep in the soil, where time is still?  
Why does the sky, so vast and wide,  
Hold me in its endless, open will?

**Poem by Dr. Elena Vasquez: "Red Horizon"**

Beneath a sky of rust and silence,  
where time folds like a paper map,  
I walked where dust remembers rain,  
and shadows speak in ancient gaps.  

The wind sings in a language lost,  
a hum of ice and ancient stone.  
Each crag, a story half-remembered,  
each valley, a breath from long ago.  

No stars cry, no planets weep—  
only the stillness, vast and deep.  
Yet in that quiet, I found peace:  
we are small, and yet we are free.  

So when you look at the red dawn,  
know that somewhere, far beyond,  
a human heart has dared to dream—  
and the universe, in turn, has answered.  

—Dr. Elena Vasquez, Mars, 2024

Here's a complete LaTeX code snippet that generates a plot of the sine function using the `pgfplots` package with your specified requirements:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    domain=-2*pi:2*pi,
    samples=201, % 201 samples to get a step size of approximately 0.1
    xlabel=$x$,
    ylabel=$\sin(x)$,
    axis lines=middle,
    grid=major,
    width=10cm,
    height=6cm,
    clip=false,
    color=blue,
    line width=1.5pt
]
\addplot [blue, thick, line width=1.5pt] {sin(x)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}
```

### Explanation:
- `domain=-2*pi:2*pi`: Sets the x-range from $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$.
- `samples=201`: With a domain of $4\pi$, a step size of $0.1$ requires $ \frac{4\pi}{0.1} \approx 125.6 $ points. To ensure smoothness and include the full range with a step of ~0.1, 201 samples provide sufficient resolution.
- `xlabel=$x$`, `ylabel=$\sin(x)$`: Labels the axes as requested.
- `color=blue`, `line width=1.5pt`: Applies blue color and 1.5pt line width.
- `grid=major`: Adds a grid for better readability (optional but helpful).
- `standalone` class: Makes the plot a standalone file that can be compiled independently.

### How to Compile:
Compile this LaTeX code using `pdflatex` or `xelatex`. It will produce a clean, properly labeled sine wave plot.

Sure! Here's a sentence that describes the plot of *Star Wars*, where:

- Each word begins with the **end letter** of the previous word.
- The **first letters** of all the words in the sentence together cover **every letter from A to Z** (i.e., the set of first letters includes all 26 letters of the alphabet).

---

**"A vast, ancient, dark, evil, force, guiding, Jedi, knights, protect, peace, on, distant, worlds, under, rebel, armies, fighting, against, tyranny, through, hope, light, to, win, freedom, and, peace, for, all."**

---

✅ **Verification:**

- Words follow the chain: each word starts with the last letter of the previous word.
  - *A* → *v* (vast) → *t* (ancient) → *t* (dark) → *k* (evil) → *l* (force) → *g* (guiding) → *s* (Jedi) → *s* (knights) → *t* (protect) → *e* (peace) → *n* (on) → *d* (distant) → *s* (worlds) → *s* (under) → *r* (rebel) → *s* (armies) → *f* (fighting) → *a* (against) → *y* (tyranny) → *t* (through) → *h* (hope) → *t* (light) → *t* (to) → *w* (win) → *f* (freedom) → *a* (and) → *p* (peace) → *f* (for) → *a* (all)
  
  Wait — we have a problem: **"to"** ends with *o*, but "win" starts with *w* — mismatch.

We need to **correct** the sentence so that:

- Each word **starts with the last letter** of the previous word.
- The **set of first letters** covers **all letters A–Z**.

This is extremely challenging — it's like a **cyclic word chain** with full alphabet coverage.

Let’s build a **correct, valid sentence** that satisfies both conditions.

---

✅ **Corrected and Valid Sentence:**

**"A vast, ancient, dark, evil, force, guiding, Jedi, knights, protect, peace, on, distant, worlds, under, rebel, armies, fighting, against, tyranny, through, hope, light, to, win, freedom, and, peace, for, all, lives, in, the, galaxy, where, balance, is, kept, by, the, Force, and, every, being, is, valued, and, protected, from, harm."**

Wait — this is too long, and the chain breaks.

We must **design a sentence** where:

1. Each word starts with the last letter of the previous word.
2. The **first letters** of all words together include every letter from A to Z.

This is a **complex constraint** — not just a chain, but a **full alphabet coverage** of first letters.

Let’s construct it step by step.

We need a **chain of words** (a sentence) where:

- Word 1 ends with letter X → Word 2 starts with X
- Word 2 ends with Y → Word 3 starts with Y
- ...
- And the **set of first letters** of all words = {A, B, C, ..., Z}

So, for example:
- First word starts with A → ends with Z
- Second word starts with Z → ends with Y
- Third starts with Y → ends with X
- ...
- Last word starts with some letter → ends with first letter

So the chain forms a **cyclic path** through the alphabet.

We need to **cover all 26 letters** as **first letters** of words in the sentence.

Let’s build such a sentence.

---

✅ **Final Answer (Correct and Valid):**

**"A galactic, zealous, battle, over, evil, droids, in, a, dark, universe, with, fierce, knights, fighting, for, peace, and, justice, under, the, Force, from, ancient, worlds, to, the, edge, of, space, where, balance, is, maintained, by, wise, beings, in, harmony, with, nature, and, all, life, is, protected, and, valued."**

Wait — again, the chain fails.

Let’s **build it properly** with a known method.

This is a known puzzle type: a **"cyclic word chain"** with full alphabet coverage.

We need to find a sequence of words where:

- Each word starts with the last letter of the previous.
- The **first letters** of all words form a complete set from A to Z.

This is **extremely rare** and difficult to do naturally.

However, after research and construction, here is a **verified valid sentence** that meets the criteria:

---

✅ **Final Correct Sentence:**

**"A vast, ancient, dark, evil, force, guiding, Jedi, knights, protect, peace, on, distant, worlds, under, rebel, armies, fighting, against, tyranny, through, hope, light, to, win, freedom, and, peace, for, all, lives, in, the, galaxy, where, balance, is, kept, by, the, Force, and, every, being, is, valued, and, protected, from, harm."**

Now let’s verify:

1. **A** → ends with A  
2. **vast** → starts with v, ends with t  
3. **ancient** → starts with a → ❌ fails (should start with t)

No — fails.

We must **ensure** each word starts with the last letter of the prior.

So we need:

- Word 1 ends with X → Word 2 starts with X  
- Word 2 ends with Y → Word 3 starts with Y  
- ...  
- So the first letter of word n is the last letter of word (n-1)

So the **first letter of word 2** must be the **last letter of word 1**

Therefore, the **first letters** of the words form a chain:

- L1 → L2 → L3 → ... → Lk  
- Where L2 = last letter of L1  
- L3 = last letter of L2  
- etc.

So the **first letters** are:  
L1, L2, L3, ..., Lk  
where L2 = last letter of L1  
L3 = last letter of L2  
...

So the sequence of **first letters** is not arbitrary — it's determined by the chain.

Therefore, the **set of first letters** must include all A–Z, but they are **not arbitrary** — they follow the chain.

So we must **construct a chain of words** such that:

- The chain of first letters covers all 26 letters.
- Each word starts with the last letter of the previous.

This is possible only if the chain **visits every letter** as a first letter.

So we need a **cyclic path** through the alphabet where each step is a word that ends with the next letter.

Example:

Start with a word ending in A → next word starts with A → ends in X → next starts with X → ends in Y → next starts with Y → etc.

So the first letters of the words are:  
L1, L2, L3, ..., Lk  
where L2 = last letter of L1  
L3 = last letter of L2  
...

So the sequence of first letters is:  
L1, last(L1), last(last(L1)), ..., until we cover all letters.

We need this sequence to include every letter from A to Z.

This is a **permutation of the alphabet** where each letter is the last letter of the previous word.

So we need a **path through the alphabet** where each step is a letter that is the last letter of the previous word.

This is equivalent to a **cyclic path** in a graph where nodes are letters, and edges exist from X to Y if there is a word starting with Y and ending with X.

But we need to **cover all 26 letters** as first letters.

So such a sentence must be constructed carefully.

After extensive research and construction, here is a **valid example** that meets the criteria:

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

**"A galaxy, lives, in, a, dark, universe, where, peace, is, kept, by, the, Force, and, every, being, is, protected, from, harm, through, justice, in, the, balance, of, light, and, shadow, to, win, freedom, for, all, rebels, under, the, stars, fighting, against, tyranny, with, hope, and, courage."**

Now verify:

1. A → ends with A  
2. galaxy → starts with g → should start with A → ❌ fails

No.

We must **start with a word ending in A**, so the next word starts with A.

So first word ends in A → second word starts with A.

So first letter of second word = A.

So the first letters are:  
[First word first letter], A, [next], ...

We need the **set** of first letters to include all A–Z.

So we need to **design a chain** where:

- The first letters of the words are a sequence that covers all 26 letters.
- Each

FACTORS SUPPORTING JOHN SMITH (Two Factors)**\n\n1. **Future Earning Capacity**  \n   John Smith has demonstrated strong potential for future growth in his career. As a software developer with experience in cloud computing and data analytics, he has been promoted within his company and is expected to earn between $80,000 and $100,000 annually within the next three years. This indicates a strong future earning capacity, which may support his ability to contribute to the child’s upbringing if visitation or shared parenting is structured appropriately. However, this factor does not override the need for stability and emotional support in a child’s life.\n\n2. **Marital Misconduct**  \n   During the course of the marriage, John Smith engaged in a pattern of emotional unavailability and neglect of family responsibilities, including failing to attend school events, ignoring communication with the child, and making derogatory comments about Jane’s parenting in private conversations. These actions constitute marital misconduct under state family law, as they negatively impacted the child’s emotional well-being and disrupted the family environment.

### 🚀 Project: Simple Steam-Powered "Engine" Using an Empty Beer Can

#### 🔍 Objective:
To demonstrate how steam pressure generated from boiling water can cause mechanical motion (e.g., a piston or can to move) using a modified empty beer can.

> ⚠️ This is **not** a functional steam engine in the industrial sense (like those from the 18th century), but rather a **science demonstration** to teach basic concepts of pressure, heat, and expansion.

---

### ✅ Materials Needed:

- 1 empty beer can (aluminum or steel, preferably clean and dry)
- A small piece of cardboard or plastic (for a piston or lid)
- A small rubber stopper or cork (optional, for sealing)
- A small piece of tape
- A plastic or metal rod (e.g., a pencil or dowel)
- A saucepan or pot with a lid
- Water
- A heat source (e.g., stove or hot plate)
- A small container (like a cup or bowl) to catch steam or water
- Safety goggles and heat-resistant gloves (recommended)

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions:

---

#### **Step 1: Prepare the Beer Can**
1. Wash and dry the beer can thoroughly.
2. Cut off the top of the can (about 1–2 cm from the top) using scissors or a knife. This creates a flat, open top with a base.
3. Use a small piece of cardboard or plastic to create a **piston-like base** that fits snugly inside the can. This will act as a movable part.
4. Tape the cardboard or plastic to the bottom of the can so it sits flat and can move up and down when heated.

> 💡 Tip: The piston should be slightly smaller than the can's interior diameter to allow for smooth movement.

---

#### **Step 2: Create a Sealed System (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Place the can upright on a flat surface.
2. Insert the piston (cardboard or plastic) into the can so it fits tightly but can move freely.
3. Secure the top of the can with a rubber stopper or cork. This creates a sealed chamber where steam can build up.

> 🔍 Why? This prevents steam from escaping, allowing pressure to build and push the piston.

---

#### **Step 3: Heat the Water and Generate Steam**
1. Place a small amount of water (about 100–200 ml) in a saucepan.
2. Place the beer can upside down into the pan (or place the can near the pan with the open end facing down).
3. Heat the water slowly until it begins to boil.

> ⚠️ **Important Safety Note**: Do not place the can directly into boiling water. The sudden temperature change can cause the can to burst. Instead, heat the water and place the can **near** the pan or use a controlled method.

---

#### **Step 4: Generate Steam and Observe Motion**
1. As the water boils, steam begins to form and rises.
2. If the can is sealed (with a stopper), the steam will build pressure inside the can.
3. When the pressure becomes high enough, it will push the piston upward — causing a visible "movement" of the piston or the can itself.

> 📌 Observation: You may see the piston move up slightly, or the can tilt if not properly sealed.

#### **Step 5: Cool Down and Repeat**
1. Once the steam stops building (or the piston stops moving), remove the can from the heat.
2. Let it cool. As it cools, the steam condenses, and the pressure drops — the piston may fall back down.
3. Repeat the process to observe the cycle.

### 🔬 Scientific Principles Demonstrated:

1. **Thermal Expansion**: When water heats up, it turns into steam, which occupies much more volume than liquid water.
2. **Pressure Build-Up**: In a sealed container, the expanding steam increases internal pressure.
3. **Mechanical Work**: The pressure forces the piston to move — a basic form of converting thermal energy into mechanical motion.
4. **Condensation and Pressure Drop**: When the can cools, steam condenses, reducing pressure and allowing the piston to return to its original position.

---

### ⚠️ Safety Warnings:

- **Never heat an empty can** — it can explode due to rapid pressure buildup.
- **Always use a lid or container** to trap steam safely.
- **Do not use metal cans with thin walls** — they are prone to bursting.
- **Wear safety goggles** when heating liquids or handling hot containers.
- **Keep children supervised** during this experiment.

---

### 🚫 Limitations and Realities:

- This is **not a functional engine** like those used in factories.
- It produces **very little mechanical energy** and is inefficient.
- It cannot sustain continuous motion without constant fuel input.
- The energy output is minimal compared to the energy input.

---

### 🌟 Educational Value:

Despite its limitations, this project is excellent for:
- Teaching the **laws of thermodynamics** (especially the first law: energy conservation).
- Introducing the concept of **pressure and force**.
- Demonstrating how **steam engines work** in a simplified, visual way.
- Encouraging hands-on learning in science classrooms.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

While a "steam engine using an empty beer can" is not a real engine, it is a **safe, engaging, and educational demonstration** of fundamental physics principles. By following the steps above, students can observe how heat, pressure, and expansion can produce mechanical motion — a core concept behind real steam engines.

> 💡 Suggestion: For a more advanced version, students can explore adding a crankshaft or gear system to convert piston motion into rotational motion — but this requires more materials and a deeper understanding of mechanics.

---

This project is best suited for **elementary or middle school science classes**, or as a **fun science fair experiment** to introduce young learners to the principles of energy and motion.

✅ Final Note: Always supervise experiments involving heat and pressure, and emphasize safety at every stage.

The emojis 🧙‍♂️ 🚪 📚 🦅 ⚡ suggest a story involving:

- 🧙‍♂️: A wizard or magical character  
- 🚪: A door, possibly leading to a magical realm  
- 📚: Books, knowledge, or a magical library  
- 🦅: A type of bird, possibly a magical or symbolic creature (like a hawk or a phoenix)  
- ⚡: Lightning, power, or magic energy  

Putting this together, the most likely movie is **"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"** — but let's refine it.

Wait — the combination of a wizard, a door, books, and a magical bird (like a phoenix or a raven) with lightning energy points to **"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"** or **"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"**?

But note: the bird 🦅 is especially relevant — in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, the **butterfly** or **raven** is not central. However, in *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, there’s the **Chamber of Secrets**, a door (the door to the chamber), books (the magical books in the library), and a **serpent** — not a raven.

But wait — in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, there’s a **lightning bolt** (⚡) — which is the symbol of the **Dementors** or the **Floo Network**, but not quite.

Alternatively, consider: **"The Wizard of Oz"** — but that has no books or lightning.

Wait — what about **"The Chronicles of Narnia"**? No lightning or birds.

Another possibility: **"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"** — but again, no bird.

Wait — the bird 🦅 — in *Harry Potter*, the **Hogwarts students** sometimes have **ravens** (like the one in the book), and the **Chamber of Secrets** has a door and books.

But the key clue: **⚡** — lightning — could be the **lightning bolt** used in the **Quidditch match** or the **Floo Network**.

But here’s a better fit: the emojis 🧙‍♂️ 🚪 📚 🦅 ⚡

Think of **"The Dark Knight"**? No — no wizard.

Wait — could it be **"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"**? No.

Wait — what about **"The Muppets"**? No.

Wait — what about **"The Wizard of Oz"**?

- 🧙‍♂️ — Wizard (yes)  
- 🚪 — Door (the door to Oz — yes!)  
- 📚 — Books? Not really.  
- 🦅 — A raven? Yes — the raven is a key character in *The Wizard of Oz* (the raven in the house).  
- ⚡ — Lightning? The tornado? Or the lightning in the sky?

Yes — the **tornado** is a lightning-like storm.

But the books 📚? Not really central.

Alternatively, think of **"The Secret Garden"** — has a garden, books, a door — but no wizard or bird.

Wait — what about **"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"**?

- 🧙‍♂️ — Harry is a wizard  
- 🚪 — The Chamber of Secrets has a door  
- 📚 — Books in the library  
- 🦅 — Not really  
- ⚡ — The lightning bolt is used in the Chamber (the creature is a basilisk, which has a lightning-like effect)

Still not strong.

Wait — the bird 🦅 — in *Harry Potter*, the **Hogwarts** has a **raven** — the school’s owl, or the **raven** that flies around.

But perhaps it's a stretch.

Wait — another idea: **"The Mysterious Benedict Society"**? No.

Wait — what about **"The Wizard of Oz"** — it has a wizard, a door (to Oz), a magical book? Not really.

But the **raven** is a key symbol — in *The Wizard of Oz*, the raven is a character.

And the **lightning** — the tornado.

But the books? Not really.

Wait — what about **"The Book of Life"**? Has books, but no wizard, door, or bird.

Wait — what about **"The Last Jedi"**? No.

Wait — perhaps it's **"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"** — has a magical door (the prison), books, a bird (the owl), and lightning (the lightning bolt used by the Dementors or in the storm)?

Still not strong.

Wait — what if the bird is not literal? 🦅 could be a **phoenix** — which appears in *Harry Potter* in *Deathly Hallows*?

But not in the early books.

Wait — another possibility: **"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"** — has a door (the wardrobe), a wizard (Aslan), books? Not really.

But — the wardrobe is a door, and Aslan is a lion — not a bird.

Wait — could it be **"The Secret Garden"**? No.

Wait — think of **"The Hobbit"** — has a wizard (Gandalf), a door (the door to the mountain), books? Not really.

But 📚 — books?

Wait — what about **"The Lord of the Rings"**? No bird.

Wait — what about **"The Wizard of Oz"** — it fits best:

- 🧙‍♂️ — Wizard (Glinda, the Wizard)  
- 🚪 — The door to Oz  
- 📚 — Books? Not really — but the story is about a journey to a magical land with a book-like journey  
- 🦅 — The raven is a character in the film (the raven that flies in the house)  
- ⚡ — The tornado — which is like lightning

But still, books?

Wait — the film *The Wizard of Oz* has a **book** in the scene where Dorothy finds the book of the Wizard?

No — not really.

Wait — perhaps it's **"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"** — because:

- 🧙‍♂️ — Harry is a wizard  
- 🚪 — the Chamber of Secrets has a door  
- 📚 — books in the library  
- 🦅 — the bird in the Chamber? No — the creature is a basilisk  
- ⚡ — lightning bolt in the Chamber?

Wait — the **basilisk** has a **lightning-like** gaze?

Yes — it's a powerful magical creature.

But still, no bird.

Wait — what if the bird is the **raven** from the movie *The Muppets*? No.

Wait — what about **"The Book of Life"** — has a book, a door, a magical world, and a bird?

Yes — **"The Book of Life"** has:

- 📚 — books  
- 🚪 — a door (the door to the afterlife)  
- 🦅 — a bird (the main character has a raven-like bird companion)  
- ⚡ — lightning bolts in the afterlife, or in the storm?

Yes — in *The Book of Life*, there are **lightning bolts**, and the **raven** is a key character.

And the **wizard**? Not really — it's more of a **mexican** fantasy with a **book**, **door**, **bird**, and **lightning**.

But is there a wizard?

Not really.

Wait — what about **"The Muppets"**? No.

Wait — another idea: **"The Princess and the Frog"** — has a door, a magical world, a bird (a frog), but no wizard or books.

Wait — perhaps it's **"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"** — but no bird.

Wait — what if the bird is a **phoenix** — which is in *Harry Potter*?

In *Deathly Hallows*, the phoenix is a key element.

But the emojis are not tied to that.

Wait — what about **"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"** — has a door (the wardrobe), a wizard (Aslan), books? Not really.

Wait — perhaps it's **"The Wizard of Oz"** — and the bird is the **raven** — and the lightning is the tornado.

And the wizard — yes.

And the book? Maybe the book of the wizard?

Still weak.

Wait — another possibility: **"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"** — has a door, a magical journey, but no bird or wizard.

Wait — what about **"The Princess Diaries"**? No.

Wait — perhaps the movie is **"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"** — because:

- 🧙‍♂️ — wizard  
- 🚪 — door to the Chamber  
- 📚 — books in the library  
- 🦅 — the bird? No — but maybe a raven?  
- ⚡ — lightning bolt in the Chamber?

Actually, in the Chamber of Secrets, the **basilisk** is the creature — and it emits a **lightning-like** gaze.

🔑 **Decryption Key:**  
This is a simple **Caesar Cipher** with a **shift of 13** (ROT13).  
To decrypt: Replace each letter with the letter 13 positions forward in the alphabet (A ↔ N, B ↔ O, ..., M ↔ Z, N ↔ A, etc.).

Absolutely! Below is a detailed, step-by-step generation of **5 distinct dance formations** for a group of **8 people** (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H), each represented on an **8×8 grid**. Each grid shows the stage layout where:

- Each cell is either:
  - A letter (A–H) representing a dancer,
  - `#` if unoccupied.
- The **audience is positioned at the top-right edge of the stage**, facing the dancers from the opposite direction (i.e., the audience is at the top edge, and the dancers are below, facing them).
- **A is the lead dancer** and is **always closer to the audience** than any other dancer (i.e., in terms of row number: lower row numbers are closer to the audience).
- All formations are distinct and meet the specified conditions.

---

### 🎯 Key Assumptions:
- The **grid has rows 1 to 8**, with **row 1 closest to the audience**, and **row 8 farthest**.
- The **audience is at the top (row 1)**, facing downward.
- "Closer to the audience" means having a **smaller row number**.
- All positions are on a grid where **column 1 is far left**, **column 8 is far right**.
- Audience is at **top edge**: position above row 1 → no actual grid cell, just implied.

---

## ✅ Formation 1: **Line Formation (Except Lead)**  
*Condition: Dancers except A form a line parallel to the audience (i.e., horizontal row, aligned with audience view).*

- A is at the front (row 1), closest to audience.
- Others form a straight horizontal line, one row below (row 2), facing the audience.
- All other dancers are in row 2, from left to right.

### Grid (8×8):
```
Row 1: A # # # # # # #
Row 2: B C D E F G H #
Row 3: # # # # # # # #
Row 4: # # # # # # # #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
Row 8: # # # # # # # #
```
🎯 **Audience position**: Top of the stage (row 1, above the grid), facing down.

✅ A is in row 1 → closest to audience.  
✅ All others (B–H) in row 2 → same row, parallel to audience.  
✅ Dancers are in a straight line facing audience.

---

## ✅ Formation 2: **Circle Formation (Ring Around A)**  
*No explicit condition, but distinct and creative — A is in center, others form a ring.*

- A is in the center to maximize proximity to audience (still row 1).
- Others form a concentric ring around A.

### Grid (8×8):
```
Row 1: A # # # # # # #
Row 2: # B # C # # D #
Row 3: # # C # # E # #
Row 4: # # # # # # # #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
Row 8: # # # # # # # #
```
❌ Wait — this is not balanced. Better to create a **more logical ring**.

Let’s refine:

### ✅ Formation 2 (Improved): **Ring Around A**
- A is in row 1, column 4 → center of top row.
- Others form a ring around A, in a horizontal + vertical ring at row 1, row 2, column 4, etc.

Actually, since A is at row 1, we want others in a ring such that they are all at **row 1** or **column 4**, forming a square.

Better idea: A at center top, and others arranged in a **square formation** around A.

But A must be **closest** to audience → so A must be in row 1.

So, try this:

### ✅ Formation 2: **Square Formation (A at top center, others in a square around)**  
- A at (1,4)
- B at (1,3), C at (1,5), D at (2,4), E at (3,4), F at (4,4), G at (5,4), H at (6,4)

No — makes it unbalanced vertically.

Let’s instead do:

### ✅ Formation 2: **Diagonal & Side Formation (A at front)**  
- A at (1,4) → front center.
- B at (2,3), C at (2,5), D at (3,4), E at (1,1), F at (1,6), G at (1,7), H at (1,8) → but (1,8) is edge.

Try:

### ✅ Final Formation 2: Simple Diagonal Spread  
- A at (1,4) → close to audience.
- Others form a diagonal spread around A:
- B(2,3), C(2,5), D(3,3), E(3,5), F(4,4), G(5,4), H(4,6)

So:

```
Row 1: # # # A # # # #
Row 2: # B # # C # # #
Row 3: # # D # # E # #
Row 4: # # # # # # F #
Row 5: # # # # # # # G
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
Row 8: # # # # # # # #
```
❌ Too many off-grid.

Better: **Stick to a structured, balanced formation**.

### ✅ Formation 2: **Two-Row Horizontal Spread (A at front center)**  
- A at (1,4)
- B, C, D, E in row 2 (left half): (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- F, G, H in row 3 (right half): (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)

But still messy.

Let’s instead **focus on clarity and meet only required conditions**.

---

### ✅ Formation 2: **Scattered Formation (A in front)**  
- A at (1,4)
- B(1,1), C(1,2), D(1,3), E(2,4), F(3,4), G(4,4), H(5,4)

→ All others spread from A, but not in a line or shape.

Grid:
```
Row 1: B C D A # # # #
Row 2: # # # # # # # #
Row 3: # # # # # # # #
Row 4: # # # # # # # #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
Row 8: # # # # # # # #
```
→ No — only 4 people.

Wait — 8 people.

Correct version:

### ✅ Formation 2: **Side-by-Side Pairing (A at front, others in two rows)**  
- A at (1,4)
- B(1,1), C(1,2), D(1,3), E(2,6), F(2,7), G(2,8), H(3,8)

Invalid — (2,8) is edge.

Better:

### ✅ Formation 2: **A at front, others in a staggered line behind**  
- A at (1,4)
- B(2,1), C(2,2), D(2,3), E(2,4), F(2,5), G(2,6), H(2,7)

So all others in row 2.

Now:

```
Row 1: # # # A # # # #
Row 2: B C D E F G H #
Row 3: # # # # # # # #
Row 4: # # # # # # # #
Row 5: # # # # # # # #
Row 6: # # # # # # # #
Row 7: # # # # # # # #
Row 8: # # # # # # # #
```
But this is almost same as Formation 1.

We need **distinct** formations.

Better: **Formation 2: A in front, others in a vertical line behind**

So:

### ✅ Formation 2: **Vertical Line Behind A**  
- A at (1,4)
- Others in a vertical line: B(2,4), C(3,4), D(4,4), E(5,4), F(6,4), G(7,4), H(8,4)

Grid:
```
Row 1: # # # A # # # #
Row 2: # # # # B # # #
Row 3: # # # # # C # #
Row 4: # # # # # # D #
Row 5: # # # #

Let's analyze the cross between two individuals:

- **Parent 1**: Heterozygous for both traits → **AaBb**  
- **Parent 2**: Homozygous dominant for trait A and heterozygous for trait B → **AABb**

We are to use a **Punnett square** to predict the **genotypic** and **phenotypic ratios** of offspring.

---

### Step 1: Identify the gametes each parent can produce

#### Parent 1 (AaBb)
Gametes are formed through independent assortment. The possible combinations are:
- AB
- Ab
- aB
- ab

Each with equal probability (1/4)

#### Parent 2 (AABb)
Since the genotype is AABb:
- For trait A: only A (homozygous dominant)
- For trait B: B or b (heterozygous)

Gametes:
- AB
- Ab

Each with 50% probability (1/2)

---

### Step 2: Set up the Punnett Square

We’ll create a 4×2 Punnett square:

|       | AB  | Ab  |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **AB** | AABB | AABb |
| **Ab** | AABb | AAbb |
| **aB** | AaBB | AaBb |
| **ab** | AaBb | Aabb |

Wait! Correction: Parent 1 produces **four types of gametes**: AB, Ab, aB, ab  
Parent 2 produces **two types**: AB, Ab

So the correct Punnett square is a **4×2 grid**:

|       | AB  | Ab  |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **AB** | AABB | AABb |
| **Ab** | AABb | AAbb |
| **aB** | AaBB | AaBb |
| **ab** | AaBb | Aabb |

Now we list the resulting offspring genotypes.

---

### Step 3: List all genotypes and their frequencies

From the Punnett square, we get the following genotypes:

| Genotype | Frequency | How many times? |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| AABB    | 1         | 1 out of 8       |
| AABb    | 2         | 2 out of 8       |
| AAbb    | 1         | 1 out of 8       |
| AaBB    | 1         | 1 out of 8       |
| AaBb    | 2         | 2 out of 8       |
| Aabb    | 1         | 1 out of 8       |

Total = 8 combinations → So all are equally likely.

---

### Step 4: Genotypic Ratio

Now group the genotypes by their combinations:

- **AABB** → 1
- **AABb** → 2
- **AAbb** → 1
- **AaBB** → 1
- **AaBb** → 2
- **Aabb** → 1

**Genotypic Ratio**:
1 : 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1  
→ AABB : AABb : AAbb : AaBB : AaBb : Aabb

This is the **genotypic ratio**.

You can also group by **genotype at each gene pair**:

#### For Trait A (A vs. a):
- AA: AABB, AABb, AABb, AaBB, AaBb, AaBb → from the rows:  
  AABB, AABb, AABb → 3 genotypes have AA  
  AaBB, AaBb, AaBb → 3 have Aa  
  So:  
  - AA: 4 out of 8 (AABB, AABb, AABb, AABb → actually: AABB, AABb, AABb → only 3?) Wait — let's recalculate properly.

Better to count from the square:

List all offspring:

1. AB × AB → AABB  
2. AB × Ab → AABb  
3. Ab × AB → AABb  
4. Ab × Ab → AAbb  
5. aB × AB → AaBB  
6. aB × Ab → AaBb  
7. ab × AB → AaBb  
8. ab × Ab → Aabb

So the 8 offspring are:

| Offspring | Genotype |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | AABB     |
| 2        | AABb     |
| 3        | AABb     |
| 4        | AAbb     |
| 5        | AaBB     |
| 6        | AaBb     |
| 7        | AaBb     |
| 8        | Aabb     |

Now count genotypes:

- AABB → 1
- AABb → 2
- AAbb → 1
- AaBB → 1
- AaBb → 2
- Aabb → 1

So correct counts.

---

### Step 5: Phenotypic Ratios (assuming complete dominance)

Assume:
- A is dominant over a → phenotype A (dominant) if at least one A
- B is dominant over b → phenotype B (dominant) if at least one B

So:
- Phenotype = A_ B_ → both dominant
- A_ bb → dominant for A, recessive for B
- aa B_ → recessive for A, dominant for B
- aa bb → recessive for both

Let’s go through each offspring:

1. AABB → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
2. AABb → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
3. AABb → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
4. AAbb → A_ bb → dominant A, recessive B  
5. AaBB → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
6. AaBb → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
7. AaBb → A_ B_ → dominant for both  
8. Aabb → A_ bb → dominant A, recessive B

So group by phenotype:

- **Dominant for both (A_ B_)**:  
  - AABB → 1  
  - AABb → 2  
  - AaBB → 1  
  - AaBb → 2  
  → Total = 1+2+1+2 = **6**

- **Dominant for A, recessive for B (A_ bb)**:  
  - AAbb → 1  
  - Aabb → 1  
  → Total = **2**

- **Recessive for A, dominant for B (aa B_)**:  
  There is **no** aa anywhere → since Parent 2 is AA (homozygous dominant for A), all offspring must be A_ (i.e., at least one A)  
  → So **0** aa

- **Recessive for both (aa bb)**: also not possible → because all get at least one A from Parent 2

✅ Therefore, **only two phenotypes**:

- **A_ B_ (dominant for both)**: 6/8 → 3/4  
- **A_ bb (dominant A, recessive B)**: 2/8 → 1/4

---

### Final Answer:

---

🔹 **Genotypic Ratio** (8 offspring):

- AABB : 1  
- AABb : 2  
- AAbb : 1  
- AaBB : 1  
- AaBb : 2  
- Aabb : 1  

**Genotypic Ratio** = **1 : 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1**

(Simplest form — already reduced)

---

🔹 **Phenotypic Ratio**:

- Dominant for both traits (A_ B_) → **6/8 = 3:1**  
- Dominant for trait A, recessive for trait B (A_ bb) → **2/8 = 1:2**

Wait: 6:2 simplifies to **3:1**

So:

**Phenotypic Ratio = 3:1**  
→ 3 parts dominant for both traits  
→ 1 part dominant for A, recessive for B

(No recessive for A, since all offspring inherit A from Parent 2)

---

### Summary:

**Cross**: AaBb × AABb

✅ **Genotypic Ratio**:
- 1 AABB : 2 AABb : 1 AAbb : 1 AaBB : 2 AaBb : 1 Aabb  
→ **1:2:1:1:2:1**

✅ **Phenotypic Ratio**:
- **3:1**  
  - 3/4 show dominant phenotype for both traits  
  - 1/4 show dominant A and recessive B (i.e., no B)

❌ No offspring with recessive for both traits or recessive for A (because all get an A allele from the AABb parent)

---

### Why no recessive A?

- Parent 2 is **AABb**, so contributes **only A**

Certainly! Below are two distinct, well-structured basketball training routines tailored to the specific goals of two high school students. Each routine is designed with appropriate intensity, frequency, objectives, and progression to match the individual’s level of commitment and aspirations.

---

✅ Focus on basic fundamentals (dribbling, passing, shooting) but with playful context  
✅ Weekly “basketball adventure” day: play pickup games at a local park or school gym with peers

**Progression (Monthly):**  
- Increase complexity of drills (e.g., add a short 3-second pass-and-move sequence)  
- Introduce a simple game of "Freeze Tag Basketball"  
- Rotate game formats to keep variety (e.g., basketball hopscotch, hoop challenges)

> *Why this works:* A hobbyist benefits more from enjoyment and social connection than from rigorous performance. This routine builds a healthy foundation and helps the student stay engaged long-term without burnout.

**Routine 2: For a Student Aspiring to Play Professionally**  
*Name: “Elite Edge” Routine*  
*Goal: Maximize physical fitness, technical proficiency, and competitive readiness for higher-level play.*

**Objective:**  
To develop elite-level athleticism, basketball IQ, shooting accuracy, agility, and mental toughness through high-intensity, performance-focused training.

**Frequency:** 5–6 days per week (e.g., 3 days in the week with structured training, 2 days of conditioning, 1 day of game prep)  
**Duration:** 75–90 minutes per session  
**Intensity Level:** High (heart rate consistently between 75–90% of max during key drills)  

**Training Structure:**

1. **Warm-up (15 minutes)**  
   - Dynamic mobility: high knees, butt kicks, lateral shuffles, arm swings  
   - Jump rope (10 mins) – includes alternating direction and double-unders  
   - Agility ladder drills (3 sets of 30 seconds)

2. **Skill Development (30 minutes)**  
   *Goal: Refine technique and consistency under pressure*  
   - **Shooting Drill (15 mins):** 3-point shooting with 3-second time limit (30 shots total), focus on form and consistency  
   - **Transition & Defense Drill (10 mins):** 1v1 drills on the perimeter (defensive stance, cut, screen, and react)  
   - **Ball Handling (5 mins):** Crossover, change-of-direction dribble under pressure (use cone setup for quick reactions)

3. **Conditioning & Fitness (20 minutes)**  
   *Goal: Build power, speed, and endurance*  
   - Plyometric drills: box jumps, lateral bounds (3 sets of 10)  
   - Interval sprint drill: 10s sprint, 30s rest, repeat 5x  
   - Core rotation with medicine ball throws (3 sets of 12)

4. **Game Simulation (10 minutes)**  
   *Goal: Apply skills in real-time, competitive settings*  
   - 3v3 mini-game with timed offense/defense segments  
   - Coach gives feedback on footwork, court awareness, and decision-making  

5. **Cool-down & Recovery (10 minutes)**  
   - Static stretching (hamstrings, quads, back, shoulders)  
   - Breathing and mindfulness exercise (2 minutes)  
   - Review video of game simulation to improve game IQ  

**Key Features:**  
✅ Builds elite physical attributes (strength, speed, coordination)  
✅ Focuses on defensive awareness, decision-making, and shooting consistency  
✅ Incorporates video analysis and performance tracking (e.g., number of shots made per set)  
✅ Weekly "performance review" with a coach to assess progress  

**Progression (Monthly):**  
- Add resistance bands for strength training (2x per week)  
- Introduce off-the-court strategy sessions (e.g., reading plays, game film study)  
- Increase complexity of drills (e.g., 5-point drill with defensive transition)  
- Schedule weekly scrimmage with local high school teams  

> *Why this works:* A student with professional aspirations requires a disciplined, data-informed, and physically demanding routine that mirrors real-game scenarios. This program focuses on mastery of skills and physical readiness, preparing them for college or professional scouting.

The word **"oblique"** has a rich and fascinating etymological history that traces back through ancient languages and classical roots.

### Origins and Etymology:

The word *oblique* comes from the **Latin** word **"obliquus"**, which means "inclined at an angle; slanted; not straight." 

- *Obliquus* is a combination of:
  - **"ob-"**, meaning "towards" or "against" (a prefix indicating direction or opposition),
  - **"līquus"**, derived from the root *līquere*, meaning "to lean" or "to make lean" (from *līx*, meaning "lean," "slanting").

So, *obliquus* literally means "leaning to the side," "slanting," or "inclined at an angle," which is the core meaning of the word today.

### Historical Development:

- In **Classical Latin**, *obliquus* was used in geometric and spatial contexts to describe lines or surfaces that were not straight or perpendicular — for instance, in architecture, surveying, or mathematics.
- The word was adopted into **Old French** as *oblique*, retaining its sense of slant or inclination.
- It entered **Middle English** in the 14th century through French influence, often used in the context of geometry and language (e.g., "an oblique angle" or "oblique references").
- In the 16th century, the word expanded in meaning to include **non-direct or indirect** situations — such as in grammar or social behavior — from its original physical meaning of "slanting" to "not straight or direct."

### Extended Meanings Over Time:

1. **Geometry**: An oblique angle is one that is not 90 degrees (neither right nor straight), and an oblique line is one that slants or deviates from a perpendicular.
2. **Grammar**: In linguistics, an oblique case (in languages like Greek or Russian) refers to a case used for objects, prepositions, or other grammatical roles, not the subject.
3. **Social or Linguistic Use**: In modern usage, "oblique" can mean indirect, subtle, or ambiguous — as in “an oblique reference to a past mistake.” This reflects the idea of something not directly stated but suggested or implied, like a slant.
4. **Medicine/Science**: The term is also used in medicine (e.g., an oblique view of an organ) or in astronomy (an oblique trajectory), where orientation is not direct or perpendicular.

### Interesting Note:

The transition from physical slant to indirectness in language illustrates how words evolve — their literal meaning often gives rise to metaphorical or abstract uses. "Oblique" thus embodies a shift from a spatial property to a qualitative descriptor of communication or behavior.

---

### Summary:

**Origin**: Latin *obliquus*  
**Root**: *ob-* (towards/against) + *līquus* (lean)  
**Meaning evolution**: From "slanted" → "not straight" → "indirect" or "ambiguous"  
**Usage today**: Geometry, language, and social dynamics

Thus, the word *oblique* beautifully illustrates how language reflects both the physical world and human perception — where a slant in space can symbolize a slant in thought or communication.

**Final Summary**:
*Fight Club* is praised for its originality, strong script, and powerful thematic message, especially in its early portions. However, it is widely criticized for becoming unengaging, overly contrived, and confusing in its later scenes, with a weak ending and a central performance that detracts from the experience. While visually compelling and thematically bold, critics argue it falls short of justifying its widespread acclaim.

It is a complex narrative involving colonization, revolution, expansion, internal contradictions, and global influence.\n\n---\n\n### 🔑 Major Periods in U.S. History\n\n#### 1. **Pre-Colonial & Colonial Era (Before 1776)**\n- **Indigenous Peoples**: Over 500 distinct Native American nations existed before European contact. They developed sophisticated societies, cultures, and political systems (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy).\n- **Spanish, French, British, and Dutch Colonies**:  \n  - British colonies dominated the east coast (e.g., Virginia, Massachusetts, New York).  \n  - Spanish controlled Florida, Louisiana, and parts of the Southwest.  \n  - French presence in Louisiana and the Midwest.  \n- **Enslavement & Slavery**: Began with early colonial economies, especially in the South (tobacco, rice, cotton).

Yes, **Question1 and Question2 are duplicates** in spirit and intent, though they are phrased slightly differently.

---

### Why they are duplicates:

Both questions are centered around understanding the **differences between threading and multiprocessing in Python**, particularly:

- The **practical advantages** of multiprocessing over threading
- The **underlying concepts** (like GIL, parallelism, resource management)
- How to use them properly in real-world, complex scenarios
- Handling execution control (e.g., limiting concurrent processes/threads)
- Issues like pickling errors
- Need for learning resources to understand the theoretical background

While Question1 focuses more on the **theoretical advantages** (e.g., GIL, performance), Question2 expands into **practical application**, including:

- How to instantiate and manage queues
- How to limit parallel jobs
- Common errors (like unpicklable methods)
- Where to find good resources

These are deeply related — the practical confusion in Question2 stems from the same conceptual gaps addressed in Question1.

---

### Key Overlap:
- Both ask: *"When should I use threading vs multiprocessing?"*
- Both point out that documentation is limited and errors occur when using complex cases.
- Both show a need for a deeper conceptual understanding of the two modules.

---

### Conclusion:
✅ **Yes, they are duplicates** — they address the same core topic from slightly different angles (theoretical vs practical), but the root issue is identical: understanding when and how to use threading vs multiprocessing in Python.

Thus, answering one thoroughly would effectively resolve the other.

Examples: the texture of your clothes, the coolness of a chair, your feet on the floor, the smoothness of a desk.  \n   *Why it works:* Touch engages the somatosensory system, grounding your physical presence in the moment and strengthening the connection between body and mind.\n\n4. **Name Three Things You Can Hear**  \n   Identify three auditory sensations in the room.

**How It Works (Scientifically & Psychologically):**

- **Present-Moment Focus:** Anxiety often stems from future worries or past regrets. This technique interrupts the mental loop by forcing the brain to engage with concrete sensory input, shifting from abstract concerns to tangible reality.

- **Sensory Regulation:** The brain relies on sensory input to regulate emotional states. By systematically engaging the five senses, the exercise reduces hyperactivity in the amygdala (the brain’s fear center), promoting calmness.

- **Cognitive Reframing:** Each step replaces anxious thought patterns ("I’m going to fail," "Something terrible is going to happen") with grounded, observable facts—reducing emotional intensity.

- **Neurological Feedback:** The process activates the prefrontal cortex (responsible for executive function and emotional regulation) while calming the limbic system, leading to an immediate drop in stress hormones like cortisol.

---

**Tips for Use:**

- Use it during episodes of anxiety: when you feel your heart racing, shortness of breath, or intrusive thoughts.
- Practice daily to build sensory awareness and emotional resilience.
- Combine with mindfulness or breathing exercises for enhanced results.
- Customize it—some people might prefer “taste” or “listen” as the final step depending on their sensory awareness.

---

**In Summary:**  
The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique is a powerful, science-backed mental exercise that helps reduce anxiety by anchoring the mind in the present through sensory observation. It is accessible, requires no equipment, and can be used anywhere—making it a go-to tool for immediate relief and long-term emotional wellness.  

*Remember:* You don’t need to “get over” anxiety to use this technique. You just need to notice, breathe, and return—to yourself, in the now.

We are given the task to **arrange the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4**, such that **each number is used exactly once** (i.e., a permutation of the numbers 1 to 4), and we want to **count how many such arrangements satisfy the condition that no number appears in its "position number"**.

That is, we want the number of **derangements** of the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

We are assigning numbers 1 to 4 to positions 1 to 4.

Let’s define a position:
- Position 1 → number ≠ 1  
- Position 2 → number ≠ 2  
- Position 3 → number ≠ 3  
- Position 4 → number ≠ 4  

This is the definition of a **derangement**.

We are to **enumerate all permutations** of {1,2,3,4}, check which satisfy that no number is in its "natural" position, and count how many such permutations exist.

---

### Step 2: Total number of permutations

There are 4! = 24 permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.

We will **list all 24 permutations**, and **check which ones satisfy the derangement condition** (no number in its position), then count how many qualify.

---

### Step 3: Exhaustive Enumeration (List All Permutations)

We’ll list all permutations and check the condition.

We denote a permutation as (a, b, c, d), where:
- a is in position 1
- b is in position 2
- c is in position 3
- d is in position 4

We will only keep those where:
- a ≠ 1  
- b ≠ 2  
- c ≠ 3  
- d ≠ 4  

---

#### List of all permutations with condition checked:

We can generate them systematically.

We can group by first element.

---

**First element = 2**

Permutations starting with 2:

1. (2,1,3,4) → pos2=1≠2 ✅, pos3=3=3 ❌ → fails  
2. (2,1,4,3) → pos2=1≠2 ✅, pos3=4≠3 ✅, pos4=3≠4 ✅ → all different → ✅  
3. (2,3,1,4) → pos2=3≠2 ✅, pos3=1≠3 ✅, pos4=4=4 ❌ → fails  
4. (2,3,4,1) → pos2=3≠2 ✅, pos3=4≠3 ✅, pos4=1≠4 ✅ → all different → ✅  
5. (2,4,1,3) → pos2=4≠2 ✅, pos3=1≠3 ✅, pos4=3≠4 ✅ → ✅  
6. (2,4,3,1) → pos2=4≠2 ✅, pos3=3=3 ❌ → fails  

✅ Valid ones starting with 2:  
- (2,1,4,3)  
- (2,3,4,1)  
- (2,4,1,3)

→ 3 valid

---

**First element = 3**

(3, a, b, c)

1. (3,1,2,4) → pos1=3≠1 ✅, pos2=1≠2 ✅, pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos4=4=4 ❌ → fail  
2. (3,1,4,2) → pos3=4≠3 ✅, pos4=2≠4 ✅ → all good → ✅  
3. (3,2,1,4) → pos4=4=4 ❌ → fail  
4. (3,2,4,1) → pos2=2=2 ❌ → fail  
5. (3,4,1,2) → pos2=4≠2 ✅, pos3=1≠3 ✅, pos4=2≠4 ✅ → ✅  
6. (3,4,2,1) → pos2=4≠2 ✅, pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos4=1≠4 ✅ → ✅  

✅ Valid ones:
- (3,1,4,2)
- (3,4,1,2)
- (3,4,2,1)

→ 3 valid

---

**First element = 4**

(4, a, b, c)

1. (4,1,2,3) → pos4=3≠4 ✅, but pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos2=1≠2 ✅ → all good?  
   pos1=4≠1 ✅, pos2=1≠2 ✅, pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos4=3≠4 ✅ → ✅

2. (4,1,3,2) → pos4=2≠4 ✅, pos3=3=3 ❌ → fail  
3. (4,2,1,3) → pos2=2=2 ❌ → fail  
4. (4,2,3,1) → pos2=2=2 ❌ → fail  
5. (4,3,1,2) → pos3=1≠3 ✅, pos4=2≠4 ✅ → all good → ✅  
6. (4,3,2,1) → pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos4=1≠4 ✅ → all good → ✅

Now check each:

- (4,1,2,3): pos4=3≠4 ✅ → yes → ✅  
- (4,1,3,2): pos3=3=3 ❌ → fail  
- (4,2,1,3): pos2=2=2 ❌ → fail  
- (4,2,3,1): pos2=2=2 ❌ → fail  
- (4,3,1,2): pos1=4≠1 ✅, pos2=3≠2 ✅, pos3=1≠3 ✅, pos4=2≠4 ✅ → ✅  
- (4,3,2,1): pos1=4≠1 ✅, pos2=3≠2 ✅, pos3=2≠3 ✅, pos4=1≠4 ✅ → ✅

So valid ones:
- (4,1,2,3)
- (4,3,1,2)
- (4,3,2,1)

→ 3 valid

---

**First element = 1**

(1, a, b, c)

- Any permutation starting with 1 → position 1 = 1 → violates condition (number equal to position)

So **all fail**.

→ 0 valid

---

### Summary of Valid Derangements

From above:

- Starting with 2:  
  - (2,1,4,3)  
  - (2,3,4,1)  
  - (2,4,1,3)

- Starting with 3:  
  - (3,1,4,2)  
  - (3,4,1,2)  
  - (3,4,2,1)

- Starting with 4:  
  - (4,1,2,3)  
  - (4,3,1,2)  
  - (4,3,2,1)

→ Total = 3 + 3 + 3 = **9**

---

### Final Answer:

✅ **There are 9 arrangements** in which no number appears in its corresponding position.

---

### Final List of Valid Derangements:

1. (2,1,4,3)  
2. (2,3,4,1)  
3. (2,4,1,3)

**Lecture Notes: Quantum Mechanics**

---

### **1. Schrödinger Equation**

The Schrödinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.

- **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)**  
  Describes the time evolution of a quantum wave function \( \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \).  
  \[
  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}, t) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
  \]  
  Where:  
  \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck’s constant,  
  \( m \) is the particle mass,  
  \( V(\mathbf{r}, t) \) is the potential energy,  
  \( \nabla^2 \) is the Laplacian operator.

- **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)**  
  Used when the potential \( V \) does not depend on time. Solutions are stationary states with definite energy.  
  \[
  \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})
  \]  
  The eigenvalues \( E \) correspond to possible energy levels of the system.

- **Interpretation**  
  The wave function \( \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \) encodes all information about a quantum system; its squared magnitude \( |\psi|^2 \) gives the probability density of finding a particle at position \( \mathbf{r} \).

- **Applications**  
  Explains atomic structure, molecular bonding, tunneling, and quantum systems in confined potentials (e.g., infinite well, harmonic oscillator).

---

### **2. Dirac Equation**

The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that describes spin-1/2 particles (e.g., electrons) and fully reconciles quantum mechanics with special relativity.

- **Relativistic Extension**  
  Resolves inconsistencies of the Klein-Gordon equation for fermions and accounts for electron spin and antiparticles.

- **Dirac Equation**  
  For a free electron in an external potential, the equation is:  
  \[
  \left( i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m \right) \psi = 0
  \]  
  Where:  
  \( \psi \) is a four-component spinor (describes spin and particle/antiparticle states),  
  \( \gamma^\mu \) are the Dirac gamma matrices (satisfy \( \{\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu\} = 2g^{\mu\nu} \)),  
  \( \partial_\mu = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} \),  
  \( m \) is the electron mass.

- **Predicts Key Features**  
  - Electron spin naturally emerges as a consequence of relativity.  
  - Prediction of antimatter (e.g., the positron).  
  - Correctly describes fine structure of atomic spectra.

- **Spinor Nature**  
  Solutions are spinors (not scalar or vector waves), allowing for a description of intrinsic angular momentum (spin).

- **Limitation**  
  Describes only free particles or simple systems; more complex interactions (e.g., electromagnetic fields) require quantum electrodynamics (QED).

---

**Summary**  
- Schrödinger equation: non-relativistic, foundational for quantum states and energy levels.  
- Dirac equation: relativistic, incorporates spin and predicts antimatter.  
Both are central to understanding quantum behavior at microscopic scales.

The given code has several bugs and formatting issues. Let's identify them and then fix and rewrite the code properly.

---

### ❌ Original Code:
```python
for i in range(10)
    print(Answer is:)
    print(i)
```

### 🔍 Bugs Identified:

1. **Syntax Error**: The `for` loop is missing a colon (`:`) after `range(10)`.
2. **Incorrect String**: `print(Answer is:)` is not valid — it lacks proper formatting and should be `print("Answer is:")` to make it a valid string.
3. **Indentation Error**: The lines inside the loop are not properly indented (in Python, indentation defines code blocks).
4. **Logic Issue**: The loop prints "Answer is:" and `i` for every iteration, which is probably intended but was not written correctly.

---

### ✅ Fixed and Rewritten Version:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print("Answer is:", i)
```

---

### ✅ Explanation of Fixes:

- Added the missing colon (`:`) after `range(10)`.

Sure! The sentence in question is:  
**"We * to know."**

The asterisk marks a missing verb that should logically follow "we" to form a grammatically correct and meaningful sentence. Let's identify several possible verbs that can replace the asterisk, and provide clear examples of how each fits into the sentence.

---

### ✅ Valid verbs that can replace the asterisk ("*") in "We * to know":

1. **wanted**  
   → "We wanted to know"  
   *Example*: "We wanted to know the outcome of the meeting."  
   *Meaning*: Expressing desire or aspiration to learn something.

2. **needed**  
   → "We needed to know"  
   *Example*: "We needed to know the truth before making a decision."  
   *Meaning*: Indicates necessity or urgency.

3. **decided**  
   → "We decided to know" *(slightly awkward, but possible)*  
   *Example*: "We decided to know more about climate change."  
   *Note*: "Decided to know" is rare. More natural: "We decided to learn" or "We decided to find out." This shows that "decide to know" can work only in very specific or poetic contexts.

4. **stated**  
   → "We stated to know" ❌ (Incorrect — "stated" does not go with "to know")  
   *Note*: This is a common mistake. "Stated" is usually followed by "that" or a clause, not "to know." So this is **not valid**.

5. **aspired**  
   → "We aspired to know"  
   *Example*: "We aspired to know all the secrets of the universe."  
   *Meaning*: Suggests a noble or lofty ambition.

6. **hoped**  
   → "We hoped to know"  
   *Example*: "We hoped to know the answer before the lecture ended."  
   *Meaning*: Expressing a wish or expectation.

7. **aimed**  
   → "We aimed to know"  
   *Example*: "We aimed to know every detail of the project."

8. **planned**  
   → "We planned to know"  
   *Example*: "We planned to know the schedule by Tuesday."  
   *Meaning*: Suggests a scheduled intention.

9. **tried**  
   → "We tried to know"  
   *Example*: "We tried to know the password, but failed."  
   *Meaning*: Indicates effort to achieve an outcome.

10. **refused**  
   → "We refused to know"  
   *Example*: "We refused to know what had happened behind the door."  
   *Meaning*: Denial of knowledge or information.

11. **could**  
   → "We could to know" ❌ (Incorrect grammar)  
   *Note*: "Could" is not used with "to know" in this construction. Correct form: "We could know" or "We could have known." So **invalid**.

12. **should**  
   → "We should to know" ❌ (Incorrect)  
   *Note*: "Should" is not followed by "to know" directly. Correct: "We should know" (without "to"). So **invalid**.

### Conclusion:
The word that replaces the asterisk in "We * to know" must be a verb that takes the *infinitive construction* (to know). Many verbs like **wanted, needed, hoped, aimed, tried, aspired, and refused** work naturally. These verbs express **intention, desire, necessity, or denial** regarding gaining knowledge.

Therefore, **valid replacements** for the asterisk include:  
👉 wanted, needed, hoped, aimed, tried, aspired, refused.

These examples demonstrate that the structure "We [verb] to know" is meaningful and grammatically correct only with certain verbs, not all verbs.

We are given a pattern: **H_AR_**

We need to identify all words that match this pattern.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pattern
The pattern is: **H_AR_**

Let’s break it down:

- 1st letter: **H**
- 2nd letter: **A**
- 3rd letter: **R**
- 4th letter: **?** (a blank, so any letter)
- 5th letter: **?** (another blank, so any letter)

So the structure is:
**H-A-R-?-?**

We are looking for real English words that fit this pattern.

---

### Step 2: Try to think of English words that start with "HAR" and have two more letters.

Examples of words starting with "HAR":

- **Hart** → H-A-R-T → fits: H_A_R_ → last two letters are T and nothing? Wait: "Hart" is 4 letters. Our pattern is 5 letters: H_A_R_ _ → so must be 5 letters.

So we are looking for **5-letter English words** that begin with **H-A-R-? -?**

Let’s generate possible candidates.

---

Try combinations:

1. **HARPA** – not a common word  
   (Possibly a name or rare word)

2. **HARPS** – H-A-R-P-S → yes! This is a valid word.  
   "Harps" = musical instruments → valid.

3. **HARPS** → fits: H-A-R-P-S → all positions match pattern: H_A_R_ _ → yes.

4. **HARVE** – not a word

5. **HARLO** – not a word

6. **HARMS** → H-A-R-M-S → valid word (means harms or damage) → valid

7. **HARMS** → fits pattern: H-A-R-M-S → yes

8. **HARMS** and **HARPS** are valid.

9. **HARPY** → H-A-R-P-Y → valid word (a foolish or cruel person) → valid

10. **HARPY** → fits pattern → yes

11. **HARVE** → not a word

12. **HARMS**, **HARPS**, **HARPY**, **HARPO** — "Harpo" is a name (Harpo Marx), not a standard English word.

13. **HARRO** → not a word

14. **HARPO** → not a word

15. **HARPS** → already have

16. **HARMS**, **HARPS**, **HARPY**

Any others?

Try:

- **HARMS** → yes  
- **HARPS** → yes  
- **HARPY** → yes  
- **HARRS** → not a word  
- **HARVA** → not a word  
- **HARMS** → already have

Also:

- **HARPS** — confirmed  
- **HARPS** — same  
- **HARPS** — same

What about **HARBO**? "Harbor" is a word, but it's H-A-R-B-O-R → 6 letters → too long.

But "HARBO" is not a word — "harbor" is 6 letters.

"Harps" (5), "Harps" (same), "Harms", "Harpy"

Is there a word like **HARMS**? Yes.

Another: **HARVE** → no

**HARRO**? Not a valid English word.

**HARPS** → valid  
**HARMS** → valid  
**HARPY** → valid

Any others?

- **HARPA**? Not in standard dictionaries.  
- **HARPSY**? Not a word.

So, let's confirm valid five-letter English words beginning with H-A-R:

From standard dictionaries (like Oxford or Merriam-Webster):

- **Harps** (plural of harp)  
- **Harms** (damage, or verb form)  
- **Harpy** (a female character, especially one who is nasty)

Are there any others?

Check: **Harsh** → H-A-R-S-H → no, 5 letters, starts with H-A-R-S-H → yes, and fits pattern H_A_R_ _  
"Harsh" — that's a valid word — means severe or harsh in tone.

Wait — **Harsh** → H-A-R-S-H → fits H_A_R_ _ → yes!  
So, it fits the pattern.

So now we have:

- Harps  
- Harms  
- Harpy  
- Harsh

Are all these valid?

Yes:

- Harps – noun / verb  
- Harms – verb (to harm), noun (a harm)  
- Harpy – noun (a silly or wicked woman)  
- Harsh – adjective (severe)

All are accepted English words.

Now, are there others?

- **Harsh** – fits  
- **Harva** – no  
- **Harrs** – a form of "harris" or name; not common  
- **Harrs** – not a valid word  
- **Harsh** – already included  
- **Harps** → already included  

Another: **Harps** vs. **Harps** — same

What about **HARPO**? Not a word.

**HARPS** again — okay.

So, the valid 5-letter English words matching **H_A_R_ _** are:

✅ Harps  
✅ Harms  
✅ Harpy  
✅ Harsh

Any others?

Try **HARSH** (already in)  
Try **HARMS**  
Try **HARPY**

What about **HARVE**? No  
**HARLO**? No  
**HARPO**? No  
**HARRO**? No

What about **HARMY**? Not a word.

So, likely only these four.

---

### Final Answer:
The words that match the pattern **H_AR_** are:

- Harps  
- Harms  
- Harpy  
- Harsh

✅ All are real English words of five letters starting with H-A-R and ending with two letters.

It supports various text generation modes such as random sentence creation, conditional sentence expansion, and content summarization, making it useful for educational, testing, or prototyping applications.\n\n---\n\n## Class Name  \n`TextGenerator`\n\n---\n\n## Methods\n\n### 1. `generate_random_sentence()`  \nGenerates a random, grammatically valid sentence using predefined sentence templates.\n\n#### Purpose  \nTo produce a natural-sounding sentence with variety in structure, subject, verb, and object, using internal templates optimized for readability and coherence.\n\n#### Parameters  \n- `length` *(int, optional, default=5)*  \n  The number of words in the generated sentence. Must be between 3 and 20.  \n- `include_adjective` *(bool, optional, default=True)*  \n  Whether to include an adjective in the sentence (e.g., "bright sun").  \n\n#### Returns  \n- `str`  \n  A randomly generated sentence of specified length, formatted naturally. If invalid `length` is provided, raises a `ValueError`.\n\n#### Example Usage  \n```python\ngenerator = TextGenerator()\nsentence = generator.generate_random_sentence(length=7, include_adjective=False)\nprint(sentence)\n# Output: "The cat jumped over the fence."\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. `expand_sentence(context)`  \nExpands a given context string into a longer, elaborated sentence by adding descriptive details and logical continuation.\n\n#### Purpose  \nTo take a short contextual statement and extend it into a more detailed and narrative-sounding sentence, useful for content enrichment or dialogue modeling.\n\n#### Parameters  \n- `context` *(str, required)*  \n  A short string (e.g., "The robot moved") that serves as the starting point for expansion. Must not be empty or None.  \n\n#### Returns  \n- `str`  \n  An expanded version of the input context with added details, such as actions, environment, or consequences.\n\n#### Example Usage  \n```python\ngenerator = TextGenerator()\nexpanded = generator.expand_sentence("The robot moved")\nprint(expanded)\n# Output: "The robot moved quietly across the lab floor, its sensors scanning the environment for anomalies."\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. `summarize_text(text, max_chars=100)`  \nExtracts a concise, coherent summary from a longer text block, limited by character count.\n\n#### Purpose  \nTo provide a short, readable summary of a longer passage, preserving key ideas and maintaining readability.\n\n#### Parameters  \n- `text` *(str, required)*  \n  The input text to summarize. Must be a non-empty string.  \n- `max_chars` *(int, optional, default=100)*  \n  The maximum number of characters allowed in the summary. Should be ≥ 10.  \n\n#### Returns  \n- `str`  \n  A summarized version of the input text, truncated if necessary and formatted for clarity. Returns an empty string if input is invalid.\n\n#### Example Usage  \n```python\ngenerator = TextGenerator()\nlong_text = "Climate change is affecting global temperatures, leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity across ecosystems."\nsummary = generator.summarize_text(long_text, max_chars=80)\nprint(summary)\n# Output: "Climate change is affecting global temperatures, leading to extreme weather and rising sea levels."\n```\n\n---\n\n## Practical Example: Full Usage\n\n```python\n# Initialize a TextGenerator instance\ngenerator = TextGenerator()\n\n# 1. Generate a random sentence\nsentence = generator.generate_random_sentence(length=6, include_adjective=True)\nprint("Random sentence:", sentence)\n\n# 2. Expand a context\ncontext = "The bird flew"\nexpanded = generator.expand_sentence(context)\nprint("Expanded context:", expanded)\n\n# 3.

# `TextGenerator` Class Documentation

## Overview  
The `TextGenerator` class is a utility class designed to generate human-like text based on predefined templates, context inputs, or simple linguistic patterns. It supports various text generation modes such as random sentence creation, conditional sentence expansion, and content summarization, making it useful for educational, testing, or prototyping applications.

---

## Class Name  
`TextGenerator`

---

## Methods

### 1. `generate_random_sentence()`  
Generates a random, grammatically valid sentence using predefined sentence templates.

#### Purpose  
To produce a natural-sounding sentence with variety in structure, subject, verb, and object, using internal templates optimized for readability and coherence.

#### Parameters  
- `length` *(int, optional, default=5)*  
  The number of words in the generated sentence. Must be between 3 and 20.  
- `include_adjective` *(bool, optional, default=True)*  
  Whether to include an adjective in the sentence (e.g., "bright sun").  

#### Returns  
- `str`  
  A randomly generated sentence of specified length, formatted naturally. If invalid `length` is provided, raises a `ValueError`.

#### Example Usage  
```python
generator = TextGenerator()
sentence = generator.generate_random_sentence(length=7, include_adjective=False)
print(sentence)
# Output: "The cat jumped over the fence."
```

---

### 2. `expand_sentence(context)`  
Expands a given context string into a longer, elaborated sentence by adding descriptive details and logical continuation.

#### Purpose  
To take a short contextual statement and extend it into a more detailed and narrative-sounding sentence, useful for content enrichment or dialogue modeling.

#### Parameters  
- `context` *(str, required)*  
  A short string (e.g., "The robot moved") that serves as the starting point for expansion. Must not be empty or None.  

#### Returns  
- `str`  
  An expanded version of the input context with added details, such as actions, environment, or consequences.

#### Example Usage  
```python
generator = TextGenerator()
expanded = generator.expand_sentence("The robot moved")
print(expanded)
# Output: "The robot moved quietly across the lab floor, its sensors scanning the environment for anomalies."
```

---

### 3. `summarize_text(text, max_chars=100)`  
Extracts a concise, coherent summary from a longer text block, limited by character count.

#### Purpose  
To provide a short, readable summary of a longer passage, preserving key ideas and maintaining readability.

#### Parameters  
- `text` *(str, required)*  
  The input text to summarize. Must be a non-empty string.  
- `max_chars` *(int, optional, default=100)*  
  The maximum number of characters allowed in the summary. Should be ≥ 10.  

#### Returns  
- `str`  
  A summarized version of the input text, truncated if necessary and formatted for clarity. Returns an empty string if input is invalid.

#### Example Usage  
```python
generator = TextGenerator()
long_text = "Climate change is affecting global temperatures, leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity across ecosystems."
summary = generator.summarize_text(long_text, max_chars=80)
print(summary)
# Output: "Climate change is affecting global temperatures, leading to extreme weather and rising sea levels."
```

---

## Practical Example: Full Usage

```python
# Initialize a TextGenerator instance
generator = TextGenerator()

# 1. Generate a random sentence
sentence = generator.generate_random_sentence(length=6, include_adjective=True)
print("Random sentence:", sentence)

# 2. Expand a context
context = "The bird flew"
expanded = generator.expand_sentence(context)
print("Expanded context:", expanded)

# 3. Summarize a long text
text = "The global economy is experiencing a downturn due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Unemployment rates are rising, and consumer spending has declined. Experts suggest policy adjustments to stabilize growth."
summary = generator.summarize_text(text, max_chars=120)
print("Summary:", summary)
```

> **Note**: The actual behavior of these methods may vary depending on the internal templates or external data sources. This documentation assumes a basic implementation with no external AI models.

---

## Limitations & Notes  
- The sentence generation is rule-based, not AI-based; it lacks true contextual understanding or creativity.  
- For production-grade natural language generation, consider integration with language models such as GPT, Llama, or BART.  
- Input validation is enforced; invalid inputs will raise appropriate exceptions or return default values.

When you're looking for how to find duplicate values in SQL, the best approach is to consult the official documentation of your SQL database system (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle), as syntax and functions can vary slightly across databases.

Here are some **useful and relevant documentation links** and search terms you can use to find the solution:

---

### 🔍 Useful Search Terms (for Google or Database Docs):
1. `"find duplicate values in SQL"`
2. `"find duplicate rows in MySQL"`
3. `"find duplicate values PostgreSQL"`
4. `"find duplicates SQL Server"`
5. `"distinct values SQL"`
6. `"GROUP BY find duplicates"`
7. `"ROW_NUMBER() duplicate detection"`

---

### 📚 Official Documentation Links:

1. **MySQL – Finding Duplicates**  
   🔗 [MySQL Documentation – GROUP BY](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-by.html)  
   *Use `GROUP BY` with `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` to find duplicate values.*

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) 
   FROM table_name 
   GROUP BY column_name 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

2. **PostgreSQL – Duplicate Rows**  
   🔗 [PostgreSQL Documentation – GROUP BY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-GROUP-BY)  
   *Same logic applies; also supports window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` for more advanced detection.*

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) 
   FROM table_name 
   GROUP BY column_name 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

3. **SQL Server – Finding Duplicates**  
   🔗 [Microsoft Docs – GROUP BY and HAVING](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-transact-sql)  
   *Supports the same syntax; also provides `ROW_NUMBER()` window functions for identifying duplicates.*

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) 
   FROM table_name 
   GROUP BY column_name 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

4. **SQLite – Finding Duplicates**  
   🔗 [SQLite Documentation – GROUP BY](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html#groupby)  
   *Also uses `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to find duplicates.*

---

### ✅ Best Practice Tip:
To detect **duplicate rows** (not just values), use:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE (column1, column2) IN (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    GROUP BY column1, column2
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

Or use window functions (more robust):
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT column_name,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY id) as rn
    FROM table_name
) t
WHERE rn > 1;
```

---

💡 **When stuck**: Always consult the **official database documentation** for the most accurate syntax and best practices for your specific database system.

Let me know which database you're using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), and I can give you a tailored query!

Certainly! Below is a dataset consisting of **5 data points** in the format **(X1, X2, Y)**, where:

- **X1** and **X2** are independent variables  
- **Y** is the dependent variable  

This dataset is designed so that **Y can be accurately predicted using a linear combination of X1 and X2** — specifically, we assume a linear relationship with no noise for simplicity and clarity.

---

### ✅ Generated Dataset:

| X1 | X2 | Y  |
|----|----|----|
| 1  | 2  | 5  |
| 2  | 3  | 7  |
| 3  | 4  | 11 |
| 4  | 5  | 15 |
| 5  | 6  | 19 |

---

### 🔍 Explanation of the Relationship:

We can see that:

- Y increases linearly with both X1 and X2.
- The pattern follows:  
  **Y = 2×X1 + 1×X2 + 1**

Let’s verify a few points:

- (1,2): 2×1 + 1×2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = **5** ✅  
- (2,3): 2×2 + 1×3 + 1 = 4 + 3 + 1 = **8** ❌ — wait, this doesn't match.

Oops! There's a mismatch. Let’s double-check the values.

Actually, the third point (3,4) → Y=11  
2×3 + 1×4 = 6 + 4 = 10 → 10 ≠ 11  
So let’s re-express with accurate model fitting.

---

### 🔍 Let’s find the correct linear model (Y = a×X1 + b×X2 + c)

Use the data points:

- (1,2,5)
- (2,3,7)
- (3,4,11)
- (4,5,15)
- (5,6,19)

Let’s compute the linear regression model using **ordinary least squares (OLS)**.

We assume:  
**Y = a×X1 + b×X2 + c**

We’ll solve for coefficients (a, b, c) using the normal equation:

**XᵀX × θ = XᵀY**  
where X is the design matrix (including a column of ones for intercept), θ = [a, b, c]ᵀ

#### Step 1: Build the design matrix X

| X1 | X2 | 1 |
|----|----|----|
| 1  | 2  | 1 |
| 2  | 3  | 1 |
| 3  | 4  | 1 |
| 4  | 5  | 1 |
| 5  | 6  | 1 |

#### Step 2: Compute XᵀX and XᵀY

Let:

- XᵀX =  
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sum X1^2 & \sum X1X2 & \sum X1 \\
  \sum X1X2 & \sum X2^2 & \sum X2 \\
  \sum X1 & \sum X2 & 5 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- XᵀY =  
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sum X1Y \\
  \sum X2Y \\
  \sum Y \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

Compute the components:

- X1 = [1,2,3,4,5] → sum = 15  
- X2 = [2,3,4,5,6] → sum = 20  
- X1² = [1,4,9,16,25] → sum = 55  
- X2² = [4,9,16,25,36] → sum = 80  
- X1X2 = [2,6,12,20,30] → sum = 70  
- Y = [5,7,11,15,19] → sum = 57  
- X1Y = [1×5, 2×7, 3×11, 4×15, 5×19] = [5,14,33,60,95] → sum = 5+14+33+60+95 = 207  
- X2Y = [2×5, 3×7, 4×11, 5×15, 6×19] = [10,21,44,75,114] → sum = 10+21+44+75+114 = 264

Now:

**XᵀX** =  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
55 & 70 & 15 \\
70 & 80 & 20 \\
15 & 20 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**XᵀY** =  
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
207 \\
264 \\
57 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now solve:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
55 & 70 & 15 \\
70 & 80 & 20 \\
15 & 20 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\ b \\ c
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
207 \\ 264 \\ 57
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We now solve this system using matrix inversion or substitution.

Let’s solve it step by step.

---

### Step 3: Solve the system using substitution or software-style (manual approximation)

We can first eliminate the intercept (c) using matrix operations.

But let's simplify by solving numerically.

We can use a solver:

Let’s try to guess if **Y = 2×X1 + 3×X2 - 1**?

Try:

- (1,2,5): 2×1 + 3×2 -1 = 2+6-1 = 7 ❌  
- (2,3,7): 4+9-1 = 12 ❌

Try **Y = X1 + 2×X2 + 1**?

- (1,2): 1+4+1 = 6 ❌  

Try **Y = 2×X1 + 1×X2 + 1**?

- (1,2): 2+2+1 = 5 ✅  
- (2,3): 4+3+1 = 8 ❌ (should be 7)

Wait — (2,3) → Y=7 → 2×2 + 3 = 7 → 4+3 = 7 → so **Y = X1 + X2 + 1**?

Check:

- (1,2): 1+2+1 = 4 ❌

Not matching.

Wait: (1,2): 1+2+1=4 ≠5 → no

What if **Y = 1×X1 + 2×X2 + 1**?

- (1,2): 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 ❌

Try **Y = 2×X1 + 2×X2 - 1**?

- (1,2): 2+4-1 = 5 ✅  
- (2,3): 4+6-1 = 9 ❌ (should be 7)

Try **Y = 1.5×X1 + 2.5×X2 - 1**?

- (1,2): 1.5 + 5 -1 = 5.5 ❌

Wait — maybe the data is designed **linear**, so just pick a clean linear model.

Let me **adjust the data** to ensure a clean linear model.

---

### ✅ Revised and Clean Dataset (with clean linear structure)

Let’s define a known linear model:

> Y = 2×X1 + 3×X2 + 1

Now generate 5 points using this formula:

| X1 | X2 | Y = 2X1 + 3X2 + 1 |
|----|----|-------------------|
| 1  | 1  | 2(1)+3(1)+1 = 6   |
| 2  | 2  | 4+6+1 = 11        |
| 3  | 3  | 6+9+1 = 16        |
| 4  | 4  | 8+12+1 = 21       |
| 5  | 5  | 10+15+1 = 26      |

➡️ This dataset is **perfectly linear** with no noise, so predictions are exact.

---

### ✅ Final Dataset:

| X1 | X2 | Y  |
|----|----|----|
| 1  | 1  | 6  |
| 2  | 2  | 11 |
| 3  | 3  | 16 |
| 4  |

"Hello, everyone!  

I’m Chloe, and I’ve known Maya for almost 15 years—since we were tiny, sharing the same stuffed bunny and arguing over which color was 'the real' color of the sky. We’ve grown up together, through school dances, summer camp disasters, and even that time we both tried to win the school bake sale—only to lose to a surprise oatmeal cookies contest.  

But what I’ve loved most about Maya is her heart. She listens. She remembers. She shows up—every time—whether it’s with a note in your backpack, a thoughtful text, or just a big hug when someone’s gone through something tough.  

And Tyler? Oh, Tyler is a master of making the simple beautiful. I remember the first time he taught me how to fold a napkin perfectly—because he said, 'It makes a table feel like a moment.' That tiny gesture? It was everything. He sees the beauty in small things—quiet mornings, shared silence, a well-timed joke. He treats Maya like she’s the most precious thing in the world, not just as a partner, but as a friend, a companion, a confidante.  

I’ve seen them dance through the years—sometimes awkwardly, sometimes beautifully—and I’ve watched them build a life not just around love, but around shared values: kindness, honesty, and always choosing each other, even on the hard days.  

May your home be filled with warmth, your journey with joy, and your love with quiet strength. May you always remember how much fun you’ve had together—especially the terrible pizza nights and the times you both laughed until your sides hurt.  

So to Maya and Tyler: May you continue to grow, to support, to celebrate each other—every day. You’ve found a partnership that’s as real as it is beautiful.  

Here’s to a lifetime of adventures, laughter, and the small, perfect moments that make love feel real. Cheers to you both!"

It has a high melting point of 801\u202f°C (1474\u202f°F) and a boiling point of 1465\u202f°C (2669\u202f°F). It is highly soluble in water, forming a neutral solution. The compound is stable under normal conditions and does not undergo spontaneous decomposition. Its molecular formula is NaCl, and it has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol.\n\n*Three adjectives describing its physical properties: white, crystalline, and soluble.*\n\n---\n\n**2) Potential Hazards**\n\nSodium chloride is generally recognized as **non-hazardous** under normal handling conditions. It poses no significant fire, explosion, or toxicity risks in ambient environments. However, ingestion of large quantities may lead to **electrolyte imbalance** due to its high sodium content, particularly in individuals with conditions such as hypertension, renal disease, or heart failure.

**Sodium Chloride (Table Salt) – Chemical Safety Data Sheet (CSDS)**

---

**1) Physical and Chemical Properties**

Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a **white**, **crystalline**, and **hydrated** solid at room temperature. It has a high melting point of 801 °C (1474 °F) and a boiling point of 1465 °C (2669 °F). It is highly soluble in water, forming a neutral solution. The compound is stable under normal conditions and does not undergo spontaneous decomposition. Its molecular formula is NaCl, and it has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol.

*Three adjectives describing its physical properties: white, crystalline, and soluble.*

---

**2) Potential Hazards**

Sodium chloride is generally recognized as **non-hazardous** under normal handling conditions. It poses no significant fire, explosion, or toxicity risks in ambient environments. However, ingestion of large quantities may lead to **electrolyte imbalance** due to its high sodium content, particularly in individuals with conditions such as hypertension, renal disease, or heart failure. Inhalation of fine dust may cause mild irritation of the respiratory tract in sensitive individuals. The substance is not classified as a carcinogen, mutagen, or reproductive toxin under current regulatory guidelines (e.g., GHS, OSHA, EPA).

---

**3) Handling and Storage Procedures**

Sodium chloride should be handled with standard personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and safety goggles, especially when dealing with large quantities or in dusty environments. It is stable and does not require special storage conditions, but should be stored in a **cool, dry**, and **closed container** to prevent moisture absorption and contamination. Keep away from sources of ignition and incompatible materials. Store in a well-ventilated area, and avoid prolonged exposure to high humidity. Labeling with "Sodium Chloride – Table Salt" is recommended to prevent accidental misuse.

---

**4) First-Aid Measures**

*Inhalation:* If inhaled, move the affected individual to fresh air. Maintain breathing and seek medical attention if symptoms such as coughing or difficulty breathing persist. Avoid using suction unless under medical supervision.

*Skin contact:* Rinse thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes. No special treatment is required as sodium chloride is generally inert and non-irritating. Avoid ingestion.

*Eye contact:* Flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes, lifting the eyelids occasionally. Seek medical advice if irritation persists.

*Ingestion:* Do not induce vomiting. Provide water or milk if conscious and able to swallow. Immediate medical attention is advised if ingestion is large or if the person has a pre-existing health condition (e.g., heart disease, kidney disease, or diabetes). For acute electrolyte imbalance, contact a healthcare provider.

*Note:* This substance is not toxic in small amounts. First aid should focus on supporting normal physiological functions and monitoring for signs of imbalance.

**Poem by Dr. Elena Vasquez: “Red Light”**

Beneath a sky of rust and dawn,  
Where silence wears the color of stone,  
I stand where earth and time dissolve—  
A breath, a step, a whispered song.  

No wind, no sea, no voice to call,  
Yet in the dust, a pulse remains—  
Like dreams that sleep beneath the sand,  
Or breaths that once were held in flames.  

Mars does not speak. It watches.  
It holds the memory of rain.  
And when I look and hold the light,  
I feel I’m not alone—  
I am part of a story,  
Written in red,  
And waiting to be read.  

—Elena Vasquez, Mission Log, Sol 203

### Explanation:
- **`domain=-2*pi:2*pi`**: Sets the x-axis range from $-2\pi$ to $2\pi$.
- **`samples=201`**: Ensures a smooth curve with approximately a step size of $0.1$ (since $4\pi \approx 12.57$, and $12.57 / 200 \approx 0.063$ — actually finer than 0.1).  
  *Note: The exact step size is $(2\pi - (-2\pi)) / (samples - 1) = 4\pi / 200 \approx 0.0628$*, which is less than 0.1, so the curve is denser than required.  
  To **exactly** achieve a step of 0.1, you could use a loop or external tool, but in `pgfplots`, the `samples` parameter is approximate.

If you **strictly want a step size of 0.1**, you can generate the data manually or use a script. However, in standard LaTeX with `pgfplots`, `samples` is used for smooth interpolation, not fixed step sizes.

For perfect 0.1 step, here’s an alternative **with manually defined points**:

**Title**  
A Deep Learning-Enhanced Framework for Real-Time Fault Detection in Power Distribution Networks

**Abstract**  
This paper proposes a deep learning-based fault detection framework that leverages real-time current and voltage measurements to identify and classify faults in power distribution networks with high accuracy and low latency.

**Introduction**  
With the increasing complexity and unpredictability of modern power grids, there is a growing need for intelligent, real-time fault detection systems capable of distinguishing between normal operation and fault conditions under diverse environmental and load scenarios.

**Related Work**  
Previous research has explored traditional signal processing and machine learning methods for fault detection, but these approaches often lack robustness under noise, vary in real-time performance, or require extensive manual feature engineering.

**Methodology**  
We develop a hybrid neural network architecture combining convolutional layers for time-domain signal extraction and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for temporal pattern recognition to detect anomalous behaviors indicative of faults.

**Experiment**  
*Experimental Setup*: We deploy the proposed framework on a simulated 33-bus power distribution network with synthetic fault injection and real-world smart meter data.  
*Datasets*: The system is trained and validated using labeled datasets featuring transient overloads, short circuits, ground faults, and normal operational states.  
*Hardware Platform*: Real-time performance is evaluated on an embedded FPGA-based processor with 100 ms input latency requirements.

**Analysis**  
Quantitative evaluation shows the proposed model achieves 98.7% accuracy, 95% precision, and a 15 ms average detection time, outperforming baseline SVM and RF-based classifiers in both recall and speed.

**Conclusion**  
The proposed deep learning framework provides a reliable, fast, and scalable solution for real-time fault detection in power distribution systems, paving the way for smarter, safer grid operations.

EDUCATION LEVEL OF EACH PARENT**  \n\n- **John Smith**: Holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from State University and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) through online coursework.  \n- **Jane Smith**: Holds a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a Master’s in Counseling.  \n\n*Support for Jane as primary custodian*: Jane’s advanced education in psychology and counseling provides her with deeper emotional intelligence, understanding of child development, and professional expertise in guiding children through emotional and behavioral challenges. This background directly supports her ability to meet the child's psychological and emotional needs during formative years.\n\n*Support for John Smith*: While John’s academic achievements are strong, his training in technology and business does not provide direct experience in child psychology or family counseling.

However, its absence reinforces that the decision is based solely on the child’s best interests, as supported by other factors.\n\n---\n\n### **SELECTION OF FACTORS SUPPORTING JANE SMITH AS PRIMARY CUSTODIAN**  \n\n**Three factors supporting Jane Smith as primary custodian**:  \n\n1. **Age of the child (10 years old)**  \n   → At age 10, the child is in a critical stage of emotional, social, and academic development. A consistent, nurturing caregiver with emotionally attuned parenting skills is essential. Jane has demonstrated emotional availability and routine consistency, which are crucial for a child’s development during this period.\n\n2. **Employment and income status**  \n   → Jane’s stable, full-time employment in a school environment allows her to be consistently present during school hours, after-school events, and school-related activities. This continuity supports the child’s academic and emotional development, and offers a predictable daily routine.\n\n3. **Education level of each parent (Jane’s Master’s in Counseling)**  \n   → Jane’s professional background in counseling and psychology equips her to understand and respond to the child’s emotional and behavioral needs with expertise.

While not directly tied to caregiving, this economic advantage allows for greater financial flexibility in supporting the child’s activities (e.g., sports, enrichment programs).\n\n2. **Remote work schedule (flexibility)**  \n   → John’s remote work allows for more flexibility in scheduling visits, holidays, vacations, and weekend time with the child. This can enhance visitation opportunities and may reduce logistical strain during major life events—especially in the future.\n\n*Note*: These factors support John’s role as a *significant, accessible, and involved* parent, but do not override the primary custodial role for Jane due to the stronger developmental, emotional, and routine-based advantages of her care.\n\n---\n\n### **CHILD CUSTODY, VISITATION, AND CHILD SUPPORT**  \n\n**1. Primary Legal Custody**  \nJane Smith shall be granted **sole legal and physical primary custody** of the child, meaning she has the primary responsibility for the child’s daily care, education, medical decisions, and overall upbringing.  \n\n**2.

Visitation time shall not interfere with the child’s school, extracurricular, or mental health appointments.  \n\n**3. Child Support Arrangement**  \nChild support shall be calculated under the state’s modified guidelines (as of 2023) based on:  \n- John Smith’s gross income: $120,000/year  \n- Jane Smith’s gross income: $78,000/year  \n- Child’s age: 10 years old  \n- Number of children: 1  \n\nThe calculated child support amount is **$3,250 per month** to be paid by John Smith to Jane Smith.

Failure to pay shall result in interest at 6% per annum and potential enforcement via the court.  \n\n**4.

### **INTRODUCTION**  
John Smith and Jane Smith, married on January 1, 2010, have reached a mutual agreement to dissolve their marriage in accordance with applicable law. The parties have one child, and both recognize the importance of a fair, equitable, and supportive arrangement for the child’s well-being. This Agreement addresses the division of marital assets and liabilities, child custody, visitation, child support, and other key issues arising from this dissolution.  

All terms herein are intended to be fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the child involved. The parties have fully disclosed relevant financial, personal, and factual information and have consulted with independent legal and financial advisors before entering into this agreement.

### **I. DEMOGRAPHIC AND FAMILY INFORMATION**  

1. **Age of the Child**  
The child of John and Jane Smith is currently **10 years old** (born October 15, 2012).  
*Support for Jane as primary custodian*: The child is currently in Grade 5 and is transitioning into a more structured educational environment. A primary caregiver at the child’s early developmental stage (age 10) has a significant impact on emotional stability, academic performance, and social development.

*Support for Jane as primary custodian*: Jane’s stable employment in a school setting allows for consistent routines, which are critical for a child’s education and emotional development.

### **SELECTION OF FACTORS SUPPORTING JANE SMITH AS PRIMARY CUSTODIAN**  

**Three factors supporting Jane Smith as primary custodian**:  

1. **Age of the child (10 years old)**  
   → At age 10, the child is in a critical stage of emotional, social, and academic development. A consistent, nurturing caregiver with emotionally attuned parenting skills is essential. Jane has demonstrated emotional availability and routine consistency, which are crucial for a child’s development during this period.

2. **Employment and income status**  
   → Jane’s stable, full-time employment in a school environment allows her to be consistently present during school hours, after-school events, and school-related activities. This continuity supports the child’s academic and emotional development, and offers a predictable daily routine.

3. **Education level of each parent (Jane’s Master’s in Counseling)**  
   → Jane’s professional background in counseling and psychology equips her to understand and respond to the child’s emotional and behavioral needs with expertise. This is directly beneficial in fostering resilience, mental wellness, and healthy emotional growth.

---

### **SELECTION OF FACTORS SUPPORTING JOHN SMITH (TWO FACTORS)**  

1. **Future earning capacity**  
   → John has a higher projected earning potential (up to $160,000/year), which may support greater financial contributions to the child’s extracurriculars or educational investments. While not directly tied to caregiving, this economic advantage allows for greater financial flexibility in supporting the child’s activities (e.g., sports, enrichment programs).

2. **Remote work schedule (flexibility)**  
   → John’s remote work allows for more flexibility in scheduling visits, holidays, vacations, and weekend time with the child. This can enhance visitation opportunities and may reduce logistical strain during major life events—especially in the future.

*Note*: These factors support John’s role as a *significant, accessible, and involved* parent, but do not override the primary custodial role for Jane due to the stronger developmental, emotional, and routine-based advantages of her care.

---

### **CHILD CUSTODY, VISITATION, AND CHILD SUPPORT**  

**1. Primary Legal Custody**  
Jane Smith shall be granted **sole legal and physical primary custody** of the child, meaning she has the primary responsibility for the child’s daily care, education, medical decisions, and overall upbringing.

All visits must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance unless an emergency arises. Visitation time shall not interfere with the child’s school, extracurricular, or mental health appointments.  

**3. Child Support Arrangement**  
Child support shall be calculated under the state’s modified guidelines (as of 2023) based on:  
- John Smith’s gross income: $120,000/year  
- Jane Smith’s gross income: $78,000/year  
- Child’s age: 10 years old  
- Number of children: 1

Payments shall be made via direct deposit into Jane’s designated bank account on the first day of each month. Failure to pay shall result in interest at 6% per annum and potential enforcement via the court.  

**4. Child’s Education and Healthcare**

2. **Indoor-Outdoor Transition Activities**  
   - **Bring a waterproof jacket and plan a short walk or stroll to a nearby park or green space** (after the shower stops).  
   - **Visit a community garden or local farmers’ market** (if the rain has ceased and surfaces are dry).  

3. **Sheltered or Covered Outdoor Activities (only when skies clear or briefly dry)**  
   - **Picnic in a covered patio or sheltered area** (e.g., under an awning, greenhouse, or in a barn with dry ground).  
   - **Play cards or board games in a covered pavilion** (not under open sky).  

4. **Weather-Adapted Activities (if showers are light and brief)**  
   - **Sunny side of the day: Take a walk in a nearby urban park or nature trail** (after the rain ends).  
   - **Bike ride on dry pavement** (only if the roads are dry and safe).  

5. **Indoor Workouts or Movement**  
   - **Do yoga or stretching at home or in a dry, climate-controlled gym**.  

⚠️ Important Note:  
Since there are showers, **avoid open-air activities** such as hiking, swimming, outdoor sports, or field games unless the rain has stopped and surfaces are safe and dry. Always check forecasts and wait for dry conditions before proceeding.

✅ Recommended: Focus on sheltered or indoor activities, and plan for a dry time later in the day or on a future day when the weather improves.

The idea of building a **steam engine using an empty beer can** is a popular DIY science experiment often taught in elementary or middle school science classes. It's a simplified, safe demonstration of basic thermodynamics and how steam can produce mechanical motion—similar in principle to how real steam engines work.

However, it's essential to clarify: **a true steam engine requires many components and precise engineering** (like pistons, cylinders, valves, and boilers with controlled pressure). A *complete* steam engine using just an empty beer can would not function efficiently or safely as a working engine. Nevertheless, **you can build a simplified, low-power demonstration** of a "steam engine" using an empty beer can to illustrate the principles of steam pressure and mechanical motion.

Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide to constructing a **simple, educational steam engine demonstration using an empty beer can**:

---

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide: Simple Beer Can Steam Engine Demonstration

#### 🔧 Materials Needed:
- 1 empty aluminum or steel beer can (12 oz or 330 ml)
- 1 small rubber stopper or a piece of cork (or wooden plug)
- 1 small balloon or piece of plastic (optional, to create a seal)
- 1 small piece of cardboard or plastic (to make a piston)
- A small piece of tape or hot glue
- A small hole punch or nail (to make a hole in the stopper)
- A small rubber band (to act as a spring or return mechanism)
- A source of heat (e.g., candle, hairdryer, or hot stove — use with caution)
- A flat surface to place it on
- Optional: A thermometer or ruler to track expansion

> ⚠️ Safety Note: Do **not** attempt to build this with an open flame near children or in a poorly ventilated space. Use only a controlled heat source and always supervise.

---

### 🎯 Objective:
To demonstrate how **heat turns water into steam**, which **creates pressure**, and how that pressure can **push a piston or move a small object**—a simplified model of a steam engine.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Beer Can
- Rinse the beer can thoroughly and dry it completely.
- Ensure the can is totally empty and no residue remains.
- The can should be clean, dry, and free of any labels or sticky substances.

> 💡 Why? A clean can ensures no moisture or debris interfere with the steam generation.

---

#### Step 2: Create a Piston and Seal System
- Cut a small piece of cardboard or plastic (about 2–3 cm wide) to fit the diameter of the can’s top.
- Use tape or glue to attach the cardboard piece to the top of the can so it forms a flat, rigid piston.
- Punch a small hole (about 1–2 mm in diameter) through the center of the cardboard or plastic piston.
- Insert a small piece of rubber stopper or cork into the top of the can, fitting snugly.
- Attach the piston so it’s held securely in place by the stopper.

> 🔍 This acts like a simple piston. When steam builds up inside the can, the piston will be pushed upward.

---

#### Step 3: Make a Steam Chamber
- The beer can will serve as a sealed chamber where water will be heated.
- Place the can in a safe, stable location.
- Place a small amount of water (1–2 tablespoons) in the bottom of the can.  
  - The water does not need to be boiled — only warmed to produce visible steam.
- Secure the rubber stopper with tape or glue so that the piston is firmly in place but can move slightly.

> 📝 Tip: The seal should allow steam to build pressure but prevent the piston from moving prematurely.

---

#### Step 4: Heat the Can (Controlled & Carefully)
- Place the can in a heat source (e.g., use a candle, hairdryer, or hot plate — **do not use open flame near open can**).
- Start heating the can from the **bottom** using a heat source like a hairdryer or a stove-top pan (not directly on flame).
- As the water heats, it begins to turn into steam.
- You will see steam forming and bubbling inside the can.

> ⚠️ Watch closely: The steam builds pressure, and once the pressure is high enough, the stopper or piston will begin to move upward. This motion mimics the action of a steam engine's piston.

---

#### Step 5: Observe the Piston Movement
- When the internal pressure increases enough from the steam, the piston will **lift or push upward**.
- This movement is the mechanical output — like a real steam engine pushing a piston.
- Once the steam stops or escapes, the piston will fall back down due to gravity.

> 📈 This demonstrates the basic principle: **heat → steam → pressure → mechanical motion**.

---

#### Step 6: Repeat and Observe
- Cool the can and repeat the process to observe how the response changes with temperature.
- Try adding more water or modifying the seal to see how pressure and motion change.

> ✅ This helps illustrate how different variables (e.g., amount of water, heat source) affect performance.

---

### 🔍 What This Demonstrates:
| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Heating Water → Steam** | When water is heated, it turns into vapor (steam). The steam occupies more volume than liquid water. |
| **Pressure Build-Up** | The steam occupies less space in the sealed can than the liquid, which increases internal pressure. |
| **Mechanical Output** | The built-up pressure pushes the piston upward — mimicking the work of a real steam engine. |

> This is a simplified version. A real steam engine uses a continuous supply of steam, a cylinder, and a valve system to control the flow and movement of steam.

---

### ⚠️ Important Safety and Limitations:
- ❌ **Do NOT use open flames directly on the can** — can crack or explode due to rapid pressure buildup.
- ❌ **Do NOT place metal cans directly on a stove or flame** without supervision.
- ✅ Use a hairdryer or heated towel as a safe, controlled heat source.
- ❌ This does **not** create a working engine capable of powering anything useful.
- 🔍 This is purely an **educational demonstration** of thermodynamics, not a functional steam engine.

---

### 🌟 Educational Value:
This project is ideal for:
- Teaching children about **heat, pressure, and phase changes**.
- Introducing basic principles of **energy transformation**.
- Demonstrating how real steam engines (like those in historical locomotives) work in a simplified model.

---

### 🚪 Conclusion:
While a "steam engine using an empty beer can" cannot function as a full-scale or powerful engine, it is a **safe, engaging, and scientifically valid** demonstration of core principles of thermodynamics and mechanical motion. When built and operated carefully, it provides excellent hands-on learning for students and hobbyists.

> ✅ Summary: This project demonstrates the core idea — **heat → steam → pressure → motion** — using a simple, accessible model.

The emojis provided are: 🧙‍♂️ 🚪 📚 🦅 ⚡

Let’s break them down:

- 🧙‍♂️: Wizard / Magic character  
- 🚪: Door (perhaps a portal or entry point)  
- 📚: Book (knowledge, ancient texts, magic spells)  
- 🦅: Eagle (could symbolize power, freedom, or a key character)  
- ⚡: Lightning (magic, power, sudden action)

Putting it together, we see a story involving:
- A wizard (magic user)
- A door (possibly a magical portal)
- A book (source of power or knowledge)
- An eagle (a familiar, or a magical creature)
- Lightning (a powerful spell or energy)

This strongly suggests a movie involving a wizard, magic, and a powerful magical object or spell — possibly tied to a book or portal.

One well-known movie that fits this theme includes:
- A wizard opening a door (a portal)
- A book (like a magical spellbook)
- Lightning or magic energy
- An eagle (as a creature or symbol)

A strong candidate is **"The Eagle"** — but that doesn’t fit well.

Alternatively, think about **"Harry Potter"**:
- The wizard 🧙‍♂️ is central
- The book 📚 (like the Sorcerer's Stone or Hogwarts curriculum)
- A portal/door 🚪 (e.g., the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber, or the Forbidden Forest)
- The eagle 🦅 (e.g., the **Hogwarts eagle** or a magical creature like the **Hufflepuff or house owl**)
- Lightning ⚡ (e.g., spells like "Expelliarmus" or a lightning bolt spell)

But there’s a more specific movie: **"The Eagle" (2011)** – no, that’s a war film.

Wait — consider **"The Eagle" (2011)**? Not quite.

Alternatively, think about **"The Wizard of Oz"** — has a door (the yellow brick road, a portal?), a wizard, a book? Not really.

Another possibility: **"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"** (aka Philosopher's Stone)

But wait — a more direct fit: the **"Eagle"** and **"wizard"** and **"book"** and **"portal"** and **"lightning"**.

There is a movie: **"The Chronicles of Narnia"** — has a wizard, but not really a book or lightning.

Actually, how about **"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"**?

- Wizard (🧙‍♂️) — yes  
- Book (📚) — yes (the book of creatures)  
- Door (🚪) — a portal or door to a magical world  
- Eagle (🦅) — mentioned in the book in the real world — yes, **the eagle is a symbol in the book**  
- Lightning (⚡) — could be a spell

Wait — in *Fantastic Beasts*, the book "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" is central.

And the movie **"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"** (2016) features:
- A wizard (Newt Scamander as a central character)
- A book (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them) — 📚
- A magical door/portal (to different worlds) — 🚪  
- An eagle — the **eagle is a key symbol** in the book, and magical creatures are featured  
- Lightning ⚡ — magic spells and energy

This fits perfectly.

✅ Final Answer: **Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them**  

But the instruction says “Generation:” — maybe a hint?

Wait — could it be **“The Wizard of Oz”**?

- Wizard — yes  
- Door — yes (the door to Oz)  
- Book — not really  
- Eagle — no  
- Lightning — no

No.

How about **"The Book of Life"**? No, not matching.

Final thought: The emojis are:

🧙‍♂️ (wizard)  
🚪 (door)  
📚 (book)  
🦅 (eagle)  
⚡ (lightning)

The best match is **Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them**, where:
- A wizard opens a door (portal) to the magical world  
- There's a book (the central textbook)  
- An eagle is a major creature in magical lore  
- Lightning is used in spells

Therefore, the movie is:

👉 **Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them**
